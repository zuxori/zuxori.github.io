Sov is a storyteller, poet, and creator. 

His works bridge classical themes, philosophy, and technology to create immersive, emotionally resonant narratives. A pioneer in the early crypto-art movement, Sov curated the Sovpunk collection and launched AI-based projects such as Guardians, Medallions, and Quattro.

His latest creation, ZU × ORI, is an epic reincarnation sequel to *Romeo and Juliet*—a genre-defying story that spans book, podcast, and interactive AI experience. Blending myth and futurism, ZU × ORI reimagines love not as a moment, but as a mystery unraveling across centuries.
