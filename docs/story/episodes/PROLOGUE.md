# PROLOGUE
#### Scene P.1 Ori  

There’s a knock at my door.  

I walk across the studio, open it.  

Zu gives me a look.  

“Ready?” she says.  

I grab my bag, we head down the stairs together. Outside on Gansevoort we look across to the High Line, watching the traffic move up and down the street.  

Zu smiles, as I tap my phone.  

I enter a location.  

The ride choices appear. I glance at them, and without hesitating, I choose Share.  

Within a minute our Uber arrives. Zu and I recline in the backseat, closely together. She’s wearing a white printed t-shirt and black jeans, and I’ve borrowed one of Hermes’ jersey pullovers. We’re watching New York City outside the windows.  

I tap a notification on my screen, as Zu leans into me.  

A news video begins playing: “In fashion news, Nepenthe, the latest fragrance from the House of Capulet, has become the biggest hit in the company’s storied history. But the so-called “feel-good fragrance” isn’t quite what people expected. Billed as the end of suffering, customers say Nepenthe is more like a leisurely walk in the park.”  

“But it’s the bottom line that matters. The House of Capulet appears stronger than ever.”  

“In a related story, memorials are being held for Tai Fang, creative director of the House of Capulet. As you know, Tai Fang was killed backstage at the Trinity Lights benefit this weekend. Details are still murky, but his creative heir Lucrezia de Rosa has been taken into custody. The question on everyone’s mind now: Who will lead the company?”  

I move to switch it off, but Zu grabs my hand.  

“On another note,” the announcer continues, “a performance at the same Trinity Lights event has gone viral. A re-make of *Romeo and Juliet* by two Trinity Rose high-schoolers has hit 100 million views across social media platforms.” The video cuts to a short snippet of Zu, bent over my body on the stage. “Viewers say the students captured the timeless magic of the famous lovers in a deeply moving way.”  

We watch a reporter talking.  

“The performance has even sparked an urban myth,” she looks into the camera, “that Nepenthe stops working once you watch the video.” The screen shows a social media post: “Y’all Nepenthe was fine, til I watched this video 😭😭😂 #feelit”  

I swipe off the app.  

I put my phone away and we’re both silent. Zu looks at me and I look at her.  

We have no words.  

“How are you doing?” I ask.  

Zu looks out the window, then at me.  

“I’m good,” she nods, then smiles.  

We pass an intersection, where our Uber pulls toward the curb. A woman in a white jacket joins our ride, climbing into the front passenger seat. She has a striking presence. For a block or so, Zu and I observe her from behind.  

The woman turns around casually.  

“I saw your performance,” she says, with clear, piercing eyes. “It really spoke to my heart.”  

“Oh,” says Zu, surprised, “thanks.”  

I am captivated by her presence. Her eyes seem to radiate with clarity and purpose. “I was looking around the audience,” the woman in white looks at Zu. “I think you touched some people.”  

“I wanted to,” Zu says, honestly.  

“Well, consider me a fan,” the woman smiles. She hands us a white card, which Zu takes. “My name is Santiaga. Look me up, if I can ever be of service.”  

She gives us a friendly glance. Our Uber pulls toward the sidewalk again, and Santiaga quickly steps out.  

We’ve hardly traveled five blocks together.  

“Didn’t have far to go,” she winks at us, before literally disappearing in the busy New York street.  

I look back out the window as we accelerate, sensing something important has happened.  

But what?  

“There’s no writing,” Zu says.  

She flips over the card.  

On the back side is an embossed white tree.  

Zu moves her thumb over the texture.  

“That’s pretty,” she turns to me.  

I look down at the tree.  

We’ve arrived at Trinity Rose.  

I look out at the school, feeling weird butterflies in my stomach. “I hate Mondays,” I sigh. Zu gives my hand a squeeze, then turns up her lip.  

“A deal is a deal,” she says.  

We get out together, on the same side, then head toward the school. I see Hermes and Kimmo, standing by the entrance. Some of the other kids are starting to notice us. They are gathering around.  

We go toward them.
