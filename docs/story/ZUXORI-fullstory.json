          "text": "My name is Zu.\nAnd I have a story to tell. The weird thing is, I’m not sure what it is.\nBut what I know—is it’s an amazing story. Maybe that’s how all storytellers feel. But this feels like my story, which is strange because I’m only 16, and I haven’t done anything too impressive. But in this story inside me, I can feel all the passion, the people, the drama and the tragedy, the heartache.\nThe love.\nSometimes I wonder, where did this story come from? Did all this come from my imagination—or somewhere else? It doesn’t matter. \nI’m the one who has to tell it.\nI’m sitting at Jack's Coffee in New York City, drawing by the dawn windows. That’s how I tell stories. I let the pencil guide my hand, until the pictures take shape. The people, the places unfold on my tablet—and slowly, bit by bit, a story begins to emerge.\nLike broken pieces of a puzzle.\nRight now, I’m drawing a grasshopper with the charcoal brush. I love the feel of the charcoal. There’s something about the black and white—it’s stark and to the point. Usually, I draw faces I see in my imagination. And of course, grasshoppers. They are the coolest insects.\nTogether these drawings tell my story. \nBut like I said, I’m not sure how. \nSo I keep drawing.\nMy teacher, Professor Lauren, likes to tell me: \"Zu, your story will find you.\"\nZu’s actually my nickname. It’s short for Zhu, my last name, which non-Chinese speakers can never pronounce. In junior high, my friends began calling me Zu—because I hated my real first name. \nWhat is it? \nOh God—I’ll only tell if you promise never to tell anyone. Did you promise? \nOkay.\nIt’s Agnes.\nCan you believe it? My parents named me Agnes! \nAgnes Zhu.\nNo offense to anyone named Agnes. But I felt I’d been handed a one-way bus ticket to the past. And I wasn’t getting on board.\nActually, in Hong Kong where I grew up, lots of people have quirky names—like Cricket, Money, or Cola. So, Agnes isn’t even that strange. But I still hated it. My mom, who chose the name, likes to remind me that Agnes means \"beautiful and pure.\"\nI don’t care.\nAnyway, Zu fits me better. There’s just something about it that feels like me. \nSomething about the sound.\nUntil two weeks ago, I lived my whole life in Hong Kong. If you’ve never been there—Hong Kong is amazing. We have more skyscrapers than any city in the world and so many beautiful beaches and hills. I went to an International School there, and I had friends from everywhere.\nIt was super hard to leave them when, this summer, my dad took a job in New York City. I wasn’t sure I’d have the courage to move so far away. \nBut I knew I had to go.\nMore than anything in my life.\nWhy? \nWell, to understand this—I need to tell you something. Something I've never told anyone. Because it doesn’t make any sense. Not even to me.\nAnd that’s okay. \nYou don’t have to believe me. \nBut around this time last year, I made a drawing. A special one. It was my first time really drawing from my imagination. The picture in my mind, not some object or something I’d seen.\nI remember it vividly: I was on the ferry coming over from Tsim Sha Tsui, when I had a sudden urge to draw. Which is odd, because I don’t draw on the ferry. But that day I did. \nAnd I remember every line.\nThat day, my imagination had no doubt. Every line, every curve, came from deep inside me. \nIt was a drawing of a young person—a boy.\nIt was just a sketch. But there was something in the texture of his hair, the tone of his chin, and mostly—in his eyes, that captured me. There was a quiet power that seemed to see right into me. As if this was someone I knew. Or rather—someone who knew me.\nOr both.\nAfter I finished, I looked up across Victoria Harbour, up at the silver rising skyline. And that’s when I knew: I was going to leave Hong Kong.\nWhen?\nTo where? I had no idea. \nBut in that instant, I knew—my life was leading me elsewhere.\nThe drawing kept bringing me back. Between classes, or on the bus, or before I went to sleep. I’d sneak glances at this face—this boy I had drawn. In my free moments, I’d take out my tablet and look in his eyes.\nIt was the strangest feeling: that I knew him, better than anyone, my parents, my friends. \nAnyone. \nAnd I felt this sadness I’d never felt before. \nIt held a power over me, like an unstoppable force. Sometimes I feared it would sweep me under, into its bottomless depth of feeling. \nLike a tsunami wave. \nI started to look for this person. This is what I don’t tell anyone—it made no sense. But I wondered if somehow this person was out there, somewhere. \nSo I looked.\nIn people’s eyes.\nWhenever I met someone—or even strangers in the street—I would look them directly in the eye. That’s how I’ll know, I told myself.\nBy the look in their eye.\nSo now, everyone thinks I have very good manners, because whenever I meet them, I look them straight in the eye. \nBut they don’t know why. \nIt wasn’t long afterward my dad was offered a job in New York City. We had to wait a whole year, though—because of the virus.\nBut now I’m here.\nSo I’m at Trinity Rose—it’s my second week as a sophomore. Trinity is like an art school, but they’re big into science and technology too. Mostly it’s about being creative—expressing who you really are, as they like to say. Whether that’s playing the cello, building a robot army, or in my case, drawing stories.\nI’ve made a few friends. \nBut I still feel pretty new. The other kids already know each other. Luckily I got assigned Professor Lauren (that’s her first name, not her last) as my advisor. She teaches theater history, and for whatever reason—we just connect. In some weird way, she’s almost like family. She’s been helping me adjust to New York and has taken an interest in my drawings.\nMy grasshopper is finished.\nI flip through my sketches. It’s a collection of the strangest scenes—places I’ve never been and faces I’ve never seen. There are flower gardens and old city squares, roses and stone fountains, dry rolling hills—and of course, the funny grasshoppers. \nThe faces are the most striking.\nIt’s like they have a life of their own, beyond my pencil and tablet. As if by drawing them, I am actually coming closer to them.\nOne of them has fierce, narrow eyes. It’s like he only sees what he wants. He has sharp features and a hard mouth. I keep drawing him differently—as if I’m trying to understand him. He doesn’t seem very nice, but I’ve developed a soft spot for him.\nAnother one wears a robe. He feels kindly and holds his hands outstretched on both sides. Like an act of penance or forgiveness. For some reason, I always draw him surrounded by nature and animals.\nThe last one is a young girl, gazing into a mirror. I can’t make out much about her, and whenever I draw her, it ends up being the same.\nBut above all, one stands out.\nThe face of the boy.\nI only drew him once. It was like my imagination captured him completely.\nIn this one drawing from the ferry.\nI’m looking at him now.\nHis features are still so vivid. In his face is a warmth and openness that touches me. It’s only a sketch, but in this face, there is so much life. \nThe alarm on my phone sounds off. \nI’m abruptly jarred from my stupor. \nI quickly collect my tablet, pencil and things, packing them into my backpack.\nI head toward the counter, to the barista.\n\"Matcha latte?\" he says.\nI look the barista directly in the eyes. I let myself be completely open, waiting to see how he will respond. To see what kind of connection we’ll make. He gives me a friendly look. But it’s nothing special.\nI collect my drink, say thanks.\nIt’s time for school."

          "text": "I ride the MTA bus to Trinity Rose, looking out the windows. The brownstone buildings and busy New York streets still fascinate me. It’s less crowded than Hong Kong, actually—but it’s busy in its own way. Between my earbuds, I watch people exiting and boarding the bus.\nWhat else can I tell you?\nI’m a pretty casual dresser—a large sweatshirt and white sneakers will do—and I have curious, brown eyes. The boldest thing I’ve ever done is dye my hair a silver purple. That was this summer. My mom nearly had a heart attack. But it’s my hair—so I’ll do what I want.\nI walk the last block to Trinity. \nThrough the treetops, I feel the warm morning sun kissing my face and arms. I approach the other kids, funneling toward the entrance. \nTrinity Rose is a gothic, ivy-bound building nestled among houses in the neighborhood. On banners outside the building is the name Trinity Rose, below a three-rose emblem. It used to be a Catholic school, but the new owners who bought it kept the name.\nNear the entrance, I’m jostled from behind. I spin around, seeing a bubbly, dark-haired girl. \n\"Kimmo,\" I catch my breath.\n\"What did you draw?\" she eyes me. She peeks into my backpack, playfully. \"Crickets again?\" \n\"They’re grasshoppers,\" I reply.\nI give her a friendly look.\n\"Lemme see,\" she grabs for my tablet, pretending to examine it. \nI met Kimmo my first day, and we bonded from the start. She’s kind of quirky and smells faintly like jasmine. And she knows everyone at the school.\nWe reach the double-doored entrance, mingling among the other kids. In the clean morning air, I can smell the ivy on the stone building, the warm aroma of granite, the dusty musk of the autumn trees, and clothing—the scent of denim and detergents, shampoos, leather bracelets and dirty shoes, even a whiff of day-old gum stuck on the back of a wooden bench.\nOh! I guess I forgot to mention.\nI have a great sense of smell. It might be the most special thing about me. \nI can smell anything from fifty feet away. For me, smell is like sight. As much as you can see, I can smell. Sometimes it’s overwhelming—being flooded by fragrances, both amazing and awful. But mostly, it’s pretty cool. This summer my friend was making lychee bubble tea inside her apartment. I could smell it a block away.\nMost people underestimate the power of smell. Think of it this way. If you’re in a room with me, I can smell you. I don’t mean in a bad way, but just—the way you smell. \nEveryone has their own unique scent, and it actually says a lot about you. I mean, we all know animals can smell fear. Well, it’s like that. Emotions, and other parts of our personality, have a smell. \nIt’s our smell.\nWho knows? Maybe that’s why I bonded with Kimmo. Her happy jasmine scent makes me smile.\nAll of you with a great sense of smell, you know what I mean. It’s actually called hyperosmia. \nMy mom even got me diagnosed.\nHyperosmia has its ups and downs. On the plus side, the most incredible fragrances of plants, flowers and foods are super alive for me. On the downside, rotting, moldy things, sweaty socks and mouse poop are everywhere.\nKimmo and I advance down the lightly-crowded hallways. I’m drafting on her jasmine scent, which wards off the odor of bad perfume and floor cleaner. Students pass us, heading into classrooms or gathering in groups.\nIt’s a sea of kids I don’t know. \nI scan their faces, almost automatically. It’s become my habit. My eyes move from face to face. I ask myself: Are you the person that I drew?\nThe one I once knew.\nThe other kids pass by, oblivious to me. I watch their eyes moving, as they gaze past me. But a few meet mine, if only for a moment. \nAnd we touch eyes.\nA curly-haired boy, with an innocent face, is one of them. He closes his locker as our eyes connect. I can see right into him. There’s a certain sweetness and kindness behind his eyes, and a shy curiosity.\nBut he’s not who I’m looking for.\nHow do I know?\nI’ve looked in so many eyes. Now I just know. Because this person—if they even exist—will know me. In their eyes, I will know they know me. \nIt will only take two seconds. \nThat’s all I need to know. \nA girl with straight, blond hair—a freshman, I think—approaches up the hallway. Our eyes also meet. I see an exciting spark, a fire behind her gaze that surprises me. I find her interesting. \nBut she’s not the one I’ve drawn.\nHer eyes only see so far. \nInside of me.\nI let her go.\nWith Kimmo, I cross the main concourse, a light-filled space with slanted skylights. Hanging from the ceiling are long banners, with the words draped across in capital letters: Trinity Lights.\nThe Lights.\nThat’s what everyone calls it.\nIt’s Trinity’s big event (our Time to Shine, as the teachers say) at the beginning of the school year. It’s a performance night and fundraiser, and anyone can enter. Basically you get five minutes for whatever you want. As long as it’s an expression of yourself.\nLast year, one girl hacked a satellite to track her cat around. That sounds pretty impressive. Another kid made their sister disappear in a hat. But you can also just sing or dance, or do a science experiment.\nAnyway, The Lights is kind of a thing. They rent out a theater, sell out tickets and people from all over New York show up for it. I heard someone got into Juilliard because of it.\nThe main idea is spontaneity. You’re not supposed to prepare too much. That’s why it’s at the beginning of the year, not the end.\nIt’s actually pretty cool.\nSo I hear.\nToday is the last day of signups. The event will be held five days from now. \n\"Are you gonna do it?\" I ask Kimmo.\n\"Nah, no talent,\" she scoffs. \nIn my mind, Kimmo is one of the most creative kids I know. I’m genuinely perplexed. \nI don’t know why she would say that. \nI make a right turn into geometry class. I hear our teacher, Ms. Mehta, announce: \"I hope everyone is ready for polyhedrons.\""

          "text": "Second period is theater history, with Professor Lauren. It’s my favorite class, mostly because of Lauren. She’s young for a teacher, and I love hearing her talk about the craft of theater and storytelling. \nI relax and lose myself in her words. There’s something calming about her presence.\nTo me, at least.\nLauren strolls among our tables. \"The original idea for theater,\" she tells us, \"was to give audiences an experience of something beyond everyday life. So they told stories of the gods, or myths—or a tragedy that connected people to their feelings.\"\n\"Or by using laughter,\" she adds, \"in the comedies.\"\nLauren holds two white, plaster masks—an anguished face for tragedy, a laughing face for comedy—one in each outstretched hand.\n\"The goal of theater,\" says Lauren, \"was to heal or purify through an experience of the soul. They wanted to guide the audience toward a grand vision of life, in their own imaginations. The Greeks called this theama. That’s why we call it theater.\"\nI look down at the table, thinking about this, while another student asks a question. \nThe second half of class is spent writing our own dramas. We practice short comedies or tragedies, taken from our own lives. \nI have nothing to write about.\nAt least not in words.\nLauren approaches my table, leaning over me gently. She smells like warm, earthy rose, if that makes any sense. I let the fragrance envelop me.\nI am the only one not writing. I lean over my tablet, outlining a bare-branched tree.\n\"How’s it going, Zu?\" Lauren asks me. \n\"Fine.\"\n\"Can I see your drawing?\"\nI pause my unfinished sketch. Aside from Kimmo, Lauren is the only one I trust with my drawings. She’s been helping me explore the people I’m drawing, and what they mean to me. \nI flip to a sketch of the hard-eyed person. Lauren taps her finger on the table. \"What is his story?\" she asks with interest.\n\"I don’t know,\" I say.\n\"He doesn’t look happy.\"\n\"No, he’s angry.\"\nI hadn’t realized that before.\n\"What’s he angry about?\" Lauren asks the question, letting me ponder the answer.\n\"I have no clue,\" I raise my eyebrows. I take a moment, looking deeper into the dark, charcoal drawing. \"He’s holding a grudge,\" I say, surprising myself. \"He wants some kind of revenge.\"\n\"Can I see another?\"\nI swipe sideways, slowly. There are two more sketches of the angry person, then a page of roses and fountains.\n\"Wow,\" says Lauren. \"I haven’t seen these.\" \nI stop at my drawing of the robed figure. Lauren reaches down, swiping past it.\n\"Who’s this?\" she asks me.\nI hesitate.\nIt’s my drawing of the boy, which I’ve never shown to anyone. Not even Lauren.\n\"I’m not sure—\" I say.\nI’m not ready for this.\nLauren peers into the drawing. She seems as absorbed by the person as I am. \nI gaze up into her face.\n\"Is he part of the story?\" she asks.\nI tighten my lips. Behind my stoic demeanor, I feel vulnerable and exposed. Somewhere in my chest is a pain I’d rather not feel. Lauren’s question is taking me beneath the surface of my feelings.\n\"I think he’s the main character,\" I allow myself to say, relieving the pressure in my chest, a little.\n\"Tell me about him.\"\nMy lips purse tighter.\n\"He’s—independent,\" I say, cautiously. \"He doesn’t like being told what to do. Or how to be.\" I feel I’m learning about him, as I speak. \n\"And he’s in pain,\" I say instinctively. \nAgain I feel the sadness washing over me. The tsunami wave again. I feel like I’m no longer in the classroom, but underwater, falling. \"He lost something,\" I say, editing the words inside my head.\nI tense up, expecting Lauren to ask more questions I don’t want to answer. \nLauren withdraws, as if about to leave.\n\"Does he have a name?\"\nI feel a wall go up. \nMy imagination won’t go there anymore. At the same time, I can feel a sound, on the tip of my tongue, almost ready to roll off. \nThere’s a power in the name. \nBut I’m not ready for it.\n\"No name,\" I turn off my tablet.\nLauren steps back from the table. \"Well, I like what you’re drawing,\" she says gently. \"Have you considered doing The Lights?\"\n\"The Lights?\" I say. \nIs Lauren crazy? All I have is a bunch of drawings.\n\"Just think it over,\" Lauren says, easily. \"It might help you flesh out your story.\"\nOr give me a panic attack.\nNo thanks."

She's with Aisha, another girl that I know. \"Come on,\" Kimmo pulls me along. \"We’re heading to open stage.\"\nTogether we go up the hall.\nIn the auditorium, students are sitting by the stage, taking turns practicing for The Lights. I follow Kimmo and Aisha toward the stage.\nWe take seats near the aisle.\nOn the stage is a ninth grader, with a homemade robot she has made. Guided by a controller, the robot retrieves an orange, and then a grape from a plate, before blowing a fuse and smoking up the stage.\nA few more kids come on. There’s an a cappella singer, followed by a juggler.\n\"You could do that,\" I tell Kimmo.\n\"I don’t juggle.\"\n\"No—but something else.\"\n\"Such as?\"\n\"I don’t know, just talk?\" I shrug. I feel like Kimmo is naturally good at everything, although nothing jumps to mind. \nKimmo turns to Aisha. Together they're exchanging the latest Trinity Rose gossip.\nBut I’ve stopped listening.\nSomething else has caught my ear. \nAt first, I hear it only as a sound, a beautiful melody of sorts. It’s barely even words.\nAnd I can’t tell who’s speaking.\n\"..my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\nTo smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss..\"\nThe words arrive like a song, a summer wind from across a field, wandering, running, leaping to my ear. I have long forgotten Kimmo beside me. I turn my head to the sound of the voice.\nOn the stage is an older boy, standing apart from the others. He is tall and strongly built, with a commanding kind of presence. \n\"That’s Landon,\" Kimmo looks at me. \"He’s a senior.\"\nThe eyes of the assembly are on him, listening in a way they weren’t before.\nOpposite him, another girl speaks:\n\"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\nWhich mannerly devotion shows in this;\nFor saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,\nAnd palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\"\nI blink, watching the two of them. I don’t know why, but I feel confused. Landon, the older boy, replies: \n\"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\"\nBut something’s wrong.\nThe warmth in my heart has turned to ice. Something is wrong with the words I’m hearing. The way Landon is saying them—it’s too cold. \nIt’s too harsh.\nI stand up, stepping forward. \n\"You’re doing it wrong—\" I say aloud, as forcefully as I can. Before I even think twice.\nEveryone stops.\nThey stare directly at me.\nThe auditorium is completely quiet. If I’m going to shrink away, now is the time.\nBut it’s already too late.\nI can’t stop my voice.\n\"The way you’re saying it—\" I say, only slightly less loudly. \"It’s just not right.\" My voice trails away.\n\"Do you have a better idea?\" the older boy steps toward me from the stage.\nI do, I think to myself.\nBut I can’t explain.\n\"Ignore her, Landon,\" says the other girl, impatiently.\n\"Why don’t you come up here,\" Landon calls out to me, across the auditorium, \"and show me?\" It’s an open invitation, not hostile.\nEither I step forward, or sit back down. \nEveryone in the room is waiting for my move. I look straight ahead, my arms by my sides. I’m painfully aware of everyone’s eyes.\n\"Just try—doing it more gently,\" I say softly, sitting back down beside Kimmo again.\nKimmo stares at me, open eyed.\nI feel Landon’s gaze upon me. But I no longer want to engage. I’m regretting I said anything at all. All I want is to hide myself inside a hole. \nI stand up, quickly, and start to walk away. As if maybe no one will notice me. \nKimmo catches up, beside me.\n\"I didn’t know you were such a fan,\" says Kimmo, enthusiastically.\n\"A fan?\" I say.\nThe edge in my voice surprises me. \n\"Of Shakespeare,\" she says.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"The scene they were doing?\" says Kimmo, obviously. \"It’s like super famous.\"\nI don’t know what she’s talking about. \nI’ve never heard those words before in my life. I am nearly out of the auditorium. \"Then what were you so upset about?\" Kimmo is asking me. \nThat’s what unsettles me. I can’t figure it out. I concentrate and keep my eyes forward, ahead of me.\nTo keep myself from shaking."

Across the courtyard, I watch Landon come up a stairway, talking to his friends. He turns away from the other boys, gazing in my direction.\n\"Uh oh—\" says Kimmo.\n\"Here he comes,\" Aisha announces. \"Do you know he did Hamlet last year?\"\nNow Landon is coming toward me. We observe each other from a distance. \nTechnically, this is eye contact. \nBut not really.\nSo here’s the deal. And trust me—I know what I’m talking about. Sure, anyone can make eye contact from across a football field. And yes, it’s eye contact. \nIt's a connection.\nBut to really get a sense of someone, you need to be closer. You can’t really feel someone from far away. You need to be in their presence. \nSo it’s not really eye-contact. \nIt’s eye-presence.\nThat means you need to be close. \nLike 5 or 6 feet. \nMax.\nLandon stands in front of us, as we all sit around. I stay focused on my cucumber sandwich. For some reason, I’m not ready to look up.\n\"Hi Landon,\" says Kimmo, brightly. \nLandon turns briefly toward Kimmo. But I can’t tell if he knows her.\n\"So,\" he says, returning to me. \"I was thinking about your suggestion.\"\nNone of us say anything. \nBut I stop chewing, in mid-bite.\n\"Why don’t you help me rehearse for The Lights?\" he says invitingly. \"Help me get it right.\"\nAisha and Kimmo look at me.\nMy eyes remain on my sandwich. But inside, my heart takes a leap. \"What about your acting partner?\" I say calmly, still gazing down.\n\"Vanessa?\" says Landon. \"She’ll get over it.\"\nI feel all my hesitation, from the auditorium—and all the reasons to say no. But is this a second chance? I know how I felt when Lauren brought up The Lights. That I didn’t want to do it. But I know there’s a part of me that does. \nAnd it won’t stay quiet.\n\"Okay,\" I say.\nAgain, it just comes out.\n\"Great,\" Landon sounds pleased. \"Tomorrow, same time?\"\nI look up, meeting him in the eye.\nAnd I let myself hope.\nAfter looking hundreds of people in the eye, I almost never hope. After so many meetings, I’ve lost some expectation. \nBut every once in a while. I hope.\nAfter all.\nAll it takes is once.\nI am meeting Landon’s gaze. For a drawn-out instant, everything else disappears.\nHis eyes have a bright, beautiful charm. I feel like I’m surrounded by them. I feel a shiver, an excitement that runs slowly up my side.\nOne second has passed.\nAnd there’s a warmth, a friendliness. It’s a feeling of being comfortable and accepted, at ease.\nLandon smiles at me.\nBut something is missing.\nI don’t feel anything. \nNot really.\nLandon’s eyes are beautiful. But after my initial shiver, that first rush of excitement, I feel empty. There’s no depth to our connection. There’s no power to it, and it barely touches me.\nI can’t get past it.\nTwo seconds have passed.\nOr maybe it’s his scent.\nI guess I overlooked it, but Landon has a smell that’s vaguely like cinnamon. It’s a peculiar kind of scent. Whatever the reason, this isn’t right. Landon is looking at me—but he’s not with me.\nI cut away.\nIt’s been two seconds.\nAnd I’m never wrong. \nBut I can still be disappointed.\n\"Tomorrow,\" I nod.\nA moment ago, I was hoping for fireworks, for a celebration in the stars. \nNow I stare at my sandwich.\nOne of Landon’s friends grabs hold of him, from behind, pulling him away. Landon glances back, before heading across the courtyard.\nKimmo looks at me, her eyebrows raised. The four of us walk out of the courtyard, down an outdoor walkway along the side of the school.\n\"That’s exciting,\" says Aisha.\n\"Um yeah,\" I say.\n\"Zu, it’s super cool,\" says Kimmo, expectantly. \"Everyone knows Landon is gonna win this year. He came in second twice before.\""

I feel a chill, like my skin is covered in a cold, damp moisture. As if the air has just dropped twenty degrees.\nImages fly through my mind.\nThen disappear.\nToo quick to catch.\nI hear Kimmo speaking, distantly, her words not quite reaching me. \"He was Lauren’s protégé. They were super close. Inseparable,\" she says.\n\"Are you cold?\" I turn to them.\nThey look at me, weirdly.\n\"Um, no.\"\nThe white dress reappears on the screen, cycling through its digital loop. For the next moments, I see nothing else. In my peripheral vision, the Trinity Rose courtyard seems to fade. Like a feeling I had once, before fainting. The chill cold wraps around my skin, through my clothing and into my bones.\nFor a split second, I see the images again. Like a glitch inside my own mind. But this time I catch it.\nA thimble.\nA green grasshopper.\nA golden sun in the fields.\nThen it’s gone again.\n\"Zu, are you okay?\"\nI can hear Kimmo again.\n\"Yeah,\" I say, stepping away. I am breaking from my stupor. \"I just—got a chill.\"\nKimmo and Aisha both observe me.\n\"Lauren never mentioned him,\" I say.\n\"That’s because she’s mad,\" Aisha tells me. \"Ori went against her by dropping out.\"\n\"Dropping out?\"\nI’m re-focusing quickly. I can’t imagine Lauren being mad at anyone. That hardly sounds like her.\n\"Did he really drop out?\" Kimmo questions Aisha.\n\"That’s what I heard.\"\n\"I heard he transferred—\" says Jaden.\n\"Or graduated early—\" Kimmo interrupts.\n\"To an art school in Italy,\" Jaden finishes his sentence. \"Or was it an internship?\" The others turn toward him. But I glance back to the bewitching white dress, cycling among the glitches and black. \nI feel compelled toward it.\n\"Hermes would know.\"\n\"Who’s Hermes?\" I ask.\n\"His best friend.\"\n\"Are they just friends?\" asks Aisha.\n\"You don’t think?\" Kimmo laughs.\n\"I’m just saying,\" Aisha shrugs her shoulders. \"Ori never had a girlfriend.\" Everyone seems to know so much—about someone they know so little. My temperature is slowly returning to normal, as we approach the double doors at the end of the walkway.\nAisha opens the door, just as a bird flies out.\nIt surprises us all. I watch it lifting above the courtyard, then landing in a high treetop."

I skip the bus ride home, walking instead.\nI pop in my earbuds, taking New York one block at a time. I glance in the storefronts lining the street. \nI don't look anyone in the eye. \nI don’t know why.\nAt my apartment, I take the elevator up.\nIt’s my dad’s last day, before his long conference in Boston. At dinner, he asks about my day. Before he leaves for the airport, we make our daily video call with my mom and brother, back in Hong Kong. This always makes me miss them more.\nI hug my dad at the door. \nWhen he leaves, I wash the dishes. \nI spread out my school materials, across the dining room table. I try to do some homework.\nBut I can’t.\nFinally I put on my headphones. I stare outward, then rise and cross the apartment, standing before our large, living room view. I look out across the city, in the twilight blue of dusk.\nLike I’m the last person in the world. \nI take a short shower, put on an old t-shirt, comb my hair and look in the mirror. I make a few faces and squint hard, as if deciding who I really am.\nI get into bed, leaning back in my pillows, turn off the light and face the darkened ceiling. \nBut something itches at me.\nI switch on my bed lamp and grab my tablet. I stare into the screen, eagerly excited.\nI type: Orion\nSearch.\nI get a bunch of pictures of the constellation—of course—and a NASA spacecraft with the same name.\nMy finger lingers over the screen.\nI type: Orion Trinity Rose\nTap.\nThere’s a couple random sites about the school—and a few odd videos. I scroll down. \nOne is titled: Trinity Lights costume design\nFrom a year ago.\nI click it.\nThere’s a grainy, faraway image of the stage. I see a line of kids in elaborate costumes, walking out in a row. At the end, someone in a blue hoodie appears on stage. They wave and quickly walk away. \nWas that Orion?\nI didn’t even see their face.\nI find another video. It’s backstage, and the person in the blue hoodie is there again. \nBut I still can’t see their face.\nI follow a few more links. I find a channel named: Orion. In the playlist is a video.\nIt says: LIVE NOW \nMy breath stops, halfway up my chest.\nI enter the stream.\nOn my screen, I see a plain looking room. There aren’t any people. The only things in my view are a table and a sofa—and hanging on a stand, a dress.\nIt’s the same white dress.\nFrom the Trinity display.\nBut nothing is happening. Like someone left the camera on—by mistake. I wait a few seconds, but nothing happens. I consider switching off my tablet, when someone steps in the frame.\nI lean forward.\nThe person walks to the white dress, then crouches down. They make an adjustment to the dress. They’re wearing a hoodie and facing away from the camera. So I still can’t see their eyes.\nBut I’m riveted. \nI keep watching, entranced.\nThe person in the hoodie stops working. For a few seconds, they don’t move at all. \nI start to wonder if the stream is frozen.\nThen I watch them turn their head, only a few inches, and ever so slowly. \nInto the camera. \nLike they know they’re being watched.\nThe person in the hoodie rises to their feet. And walks directly toward the screen.\nI’ve stopped breathing. \nIt’s silly—but I feel I’ve been caught. \nWait—is my camera on?\nCan they see me? \nOf course not—\nI compose myself. \nThey stand right in front of the screen, the hoodie over their head. I can see their jawline—but the light is low, and the hoodie hides their eyes. \nThey inch closer—looking right at me.\nIt’s so intense, I don’t breathe.\nAs if they’ll hear me. \nSo I don’t move. But I let my finger hover above the screen. Say something, I tell myself.\nMy finger hovers above the h.\nThen moves to the a. \nSay something, I shout inside.\nOn my tablet, the person doesn’t move. They’re waiting for something. For me.\nI can’t take it anymore. \nI lose my nerve.\nI slam my tablet down on the bed. I feel my heart, leaping out from my chest.\nI don’t know what just happened.\nI lie flat on my back, without moving, for who knows how long. Finally I switch off my light. \nBut I can’t close my eyes."

As if there’s someone else on the stream.\nWatching me.\nBut not in the normal way.\nThere’s a feeling behind the camera that feels so familiar. But also so far away. Like something you know so well.\nBut can’t quite name.\nI glance at the chat.\nThere’s nothing unusual there. But I can’t look away. I stare at the comments—waiting, weirdly anxious. \nBut nothing new appears.\nI lean forward, type: \nHello?\nAnd wait—\nAnd wait a bit more.\nBut there is no response. \nI step back from the screen. No, something has changed, it’s over. The moment has passed. I don’t know what’s changed. But it’s over. \nI click, stopping the stream.\nI step toward a mirror on the wall. A slim-looking boy in a blue-camo hoodie and torn jeans faces me, his eyes hidden beneath the hoodie.\nI take a step closer.\nAnd I flip back my hoodie.\nI gaze at the features of my face. I have clear eyes, I wear a simple plastic necklace, and my hair is kind-of wavy and kind-of straight. A red yarn bracelet sits on my wrist. I don’t know what came over me. I was working on the dress, and then I just felt something. \nSomething so familiar. \nLike a memory I can’t place.\n\"Admiring yourself?\" \nI turn, quickly.\nIn the doorway is Hermes, a keen-eyed boy with a glowing face and thick, full hair. He shoots me a quick, knowing glance, while he crosses the room carrying a bowl of chips.\n\"Huh? Oh—\"\n\"You alright, Ori?\" Hermes crooks an eye.\n\"Oh, yeah,\" I reply, glancing back at my camera. \"I just had a funny feeling.\"\nHermes crunches on a chip.\n\"Like what?\" He’s wearing a t-shirt that says Rose, a nickname for Trinity Rose.\n\"Like someone was watching me,\" I say. \"But it felt so familiar.\" I expect Hermes to make a clever joke at my expense. But instead he looks at me sideways, like he understands.\n\"I’m watching you, Ori,\" Hermes says to me. \"To make sure you go back to school. Everyone’s wondering where you are.\"\nI shake my head, turning.\n\"Wonder is a virtue,\" I say.\nI bounce a blue ball off the wall, then catch it again. Hermes plops down onto a canvas sofa, cradling his bowl of chips.\n\"They’re gonna find out, bro—\"\n\"From who?\" I reply. \"Every email from school gets relayed to my account. My mother,\" I say in hand quotes, \"has informed them about my condition: adolescent trauma from an allergic reaction. So my parents can continue their vacation in Italy. In peace.\"\n\"Allergic reaction,\" Hermes scoffs.\n\"To Lauren—\" I say.\n\"You’re still mad at her?\"\n\"Of course.\"\nI bounce the blue ball, quietly.\nHermes sits upright, dropping his chips and lifting his laptop in a single swoop.\n\"Ori,\" he gleams, \"check this out.\"\nHis fingers fly over the keyboard, with a speed I can’t even follow. \"Hit the lights, will you?\" Hermes says without looking up.\nI dim the room.\n\"So, I cracked the code,\" Hermes beams, still dialed into his computer. \"I wrote an extension, adjusted the z-axis—and boom!\" \nHe smashes one last key.\nI’m sitting beside Hermes. In the dimly-dark room, a solitary butterfly appears in front of us. It floats around dreamily, its wings beating in leisurely time, its color a soft and perfect pinkish blue. I’m mesmerized by its magical light and motion.\n\"Now watch,\" I hear Hermes.\nThe blue butterfly floats across the room, in loops and half-loops, before our eyes. I notice other butterflies appearing, fading in and out of darkness, like gentle, neon fireflies of the night. Soon the studio is filled with bluish butterflies of all sizes and shapes.\nMy eyes drop open.\n\"But how—\" I say.\n\"Quiet.\" \nHermes taps his keyboard.\nThe butterflies fade away, until only a single one remains, for one final loop.\nWe sit there, in the empty room.\nFrom out of the darkness emerges a deep, throaty growl. A majestic, full-maned lion swaggers toward us. The lion grows larger, approaching steadily closer, its roar growing louder. It breaks into a run, its giant paws advancing toward us. \nHermes clicks away rapidly. \nThe lion morphs in full stride into a snorting, charging rhino. It’s more terrifying than the lion, its thundering hooves shaking the floor of the studio.\nI lean backward, in the couch.\nIt’s nearly upon us.\nHermes clicks again, transforming the giant rhino into a tremendous dragon, wide wings fully extended, which swoops and levitates in the air before us, releasing an air-shattering shriek and blistering torrent of flaming breath directly at our heads.\nWe should be burnt to cinders.\nBut are not.\nHermes taps a key, the dragon vanishes, and we are left alone in the silent studio.\n\"It’s called Pepper’s Ghost,\" Hermes explains. \"It’s an old holographic trick. I hacked a dead project at my dad’s company.\"\nHe pulls up a website, quickly. \nThere's a video of his dad, Ford Wright, explaining something on stage. Watermarked on the video is the Wright Institute branding, a logo of a digital tree that catches my eye.\n\"In the old days,\" Hermes mutes the sound, \"they’d project holograms on a screen.\" He gets up, switching off a black box on the floor. \"This is way better,\" he pats the box. \"It’s an ionizer. The projection gets reflected in the microscopic ions.\"\nI’m used to Hermes’ brilliance. \nBut even I’m speechless. \"You could enter The Lights,\" I encourage him.\n\"That pony show?\" he says.\n\"No, really—\"\n\"So could you.\"\nI stand up, walking away.\n\"There’s nothing for me at school,\" I say.\n\"We talked about this already,\" says Hermes, following me. \"You’re moody and you need to get over it and stop acting dumb.\"\n\"Dumb?\" I say.\n\"You repeat me,\" he says.\n\"And you follow me,\" I say, turning around.\nHermes holds a broomstick. He unscrews the handle, pointing it at me. \"Let’s have a little duel. If I win—you get your butt back in school.\" \nHe tosses me the broom handle.\n\"Against the fencing team captain?\" I say.\nI toss it back at him. \"Nah.\"\n\"You had your chance,\" Hermes reminds me. \"I asked you to join us.\" \nHe pokes at me annoyingly with the broomstick. I retreat across the room, Hermes after me. I slap the broomstick away, backtracking along a bookshelf. Hermes pursues me, grinning and tapping the broom handle against the books. \n\"Stop,\" I say.\n\"You surrender?\"\nHe swings the broomstick at me. It’s only half-speed, but quick enough I have to duck. A few books go flying from the shelf.\n\"I’m serious—\" I say.\n\"So am I.\"\nI grab a curtain rod, blocking his attack. We circle around the kitchen, scattering paper towels and wooden spoons. \nHermes lunges at me.\nI slip, losing my rod. Hermes shoves the broomstick into my chest.\n\"Answer my riddle. I’ll let up.\"\nI’m flat on my back.\n\"Where do you need to go,\" Hermes riddles me, \"to find fortune, fate and truth?\"\n\"A dictionary,\" I say.\n\"Yes,\" he sighs. \"But that’s not the answer.\" I push the broomstick away, getting to my feet. Hermes doesn’t hinder me. \nI walk back across the studio, bothered.\nThe white dress stands where I left it, before the livestream. I come near it, carefully, like a deer that could spring away at a sound. \nI pick up my headphones from the table, place them over my head.\nPress PLAY.\nFrom across the studio, Hermes watches me. He says: \"You can’t run away, Ori.\"\nI don’t hear him.\nI’m already in my head.\nHermes walks to the door of the studio. He turns, then calls out again: \"Ori! Ori?\"\nI have music in my ears, my back to him.\nHermes watches me, then smiles to himself. He walks out the studio door."

          "text": "I take a long breath.\nI made this white dress a year ago. \nIn a flurry, one night. I knew exactly how it looked. I’d been imagining it for years. From the desert, where I grew up outside Los Angeles. From when I found the first photos of my grandfather, who was a tailor. And even, somehow, before that.\nIt wasn’t my usual style—the clothes I made for Trinity’s plays. The white dress was about beauty, nothing else.\nI used simple cotton and lace. \nIt felt so old-fashioned. So traditional. But who was I to get in the way? It was also timeless. Like an eternal, low-key wedding dress.\nAt The Lights, they loved it. \nI didn’t.\nIt didn’t feel right.\nIt was exactly what I imagined. But it left me unsatisfied. It was perfect, but imperfect. Finished, but unfinished. Complete, but incomplete. I stashed the dress in a closet. My year went downhill after that. I had a sense that something had passed, like a feeling my future had ended. And it only got worse.\nBut recently, I pulled it out.\nBecause it’s more than a dress to me. \nIt doesn’t make sense, but in the presence of the white dress, I feel connected to something more than myself. Like a memory that I’ve lost. \nI adjust my headphones, studying the dress.\nI take a seam ripper, detaching the left sleeve. This makes it more modern. A slow, pale moon rises outside my window. \nI work away at the white dress. How long passes? Twenty minutes, two hours? \nI have no idea.\nI tinker with the neckline, the bands. I don’t know what to change, but I keep trying. My eyes blaze. I step back, removing my headphones, struck with wonder and curiosity. I feel the presence of a hundred memories, just beyond my reach—all connected to the white dress.\nMemories I can’t remember. \nLike a secret I should know about myself. \nThe white dress was always a mystery. When I studied the photos of my grandfather’s tailor shop, in my mind it was the white dress I saw. I never dared to make it. It seemed too perfect. I started with simple things instead: a vest, clothes I imagined my grandfather might make, using YouTube as my tutor. Slowly I got better. I liked the feel of fabric, the touch of it. I made myself a suit. But in the back of my mind, there was always the dress.\nBy the time I got to Trinity, I had a style. I screen printed t-shirts, spray painted jeans. I’d sell them to the other kids. They asked me to do the costumes for the play. I agreed, but I always felt I was moving toward the dress. It was always about the dress.\nI lift the remaining sleeve, holding the cloth.\nI’ve always felt I had a secret.\nAs a child, I remember feeling that somehow, I was someone special. That I came from somewhere. That I’d done something in some distant past. That somewhere inside me was an amazing secret that would explain everything about me. \nHave you ever felt this way? \nThat somewhere is a secret that explains everything about you. \nThat makes you make sense. \nWhere did I come from? \nWhy am I here?\nI imagine ancient people, looking upward in wonder at the stars. Sometimes I feel this way about myself. I was born and experience life in amazing ways. But why? \nWho am I?\nThis is my secret. And somehow—in the presence of the white dress—I feel a clue.\n\"It’s only you and me,\" I tease the dress. \"What do you know about me?\"\nThe white dress is mute.\n\"Not even a hint?\"\nSometimes the memory feels so close.\nI can almost sense sunlight on my shoulders, a feeling of happiness, a single tree on a hilltop. But it’s more than scenery. There’s an anticipation. \nSomething hopeful is about to happen. Above me the wide tree sways. There are buildings in the distance.\nAm I making it all up? \nThis is the feeling: there is someone behind me. They have only just arrived. Or maybe, I have only noticed. But I feel this person behind me. And somehow, my future depends on her.\nI gaze into the far corners of the studio, where the light does not quite reach. \nAnd I turn around.\nBut of course, there’s no one there. \n\"Who are you?\" I say aloud.\nThere is no reply.\nI glance around the brick-walled studio, a converted warehouse at 71 Gansevoort Street, in New York’s Meatpacking District. I go to an open window, leaning slightly outside. Across the street is the Whitney Museum and the High Line, the classy park built on an abandoned, elevated railway line. \n\"It’s a case of amnesia,\" I sigh to myself.\nI grab a leafy book of poems, flipping pages—as if my secret was hidden inside. I toss the book away and slump onto the sofa, gazing up at the brick wall. From upside down, I see the pinned up posters of my favorite artworks and fashion designs.\n\"Amnesia is what it is,\" I decide. \nSuddenly I am exhausted. I sink down in the couch, rubbing my hands over my eyes. \nMy phone glows dimly in the darkness. \nI glance at it, disinterested. \nIt’s another email from Trinity Rose—a reminder about my absence. My eyes drift to the Trinity Rose logo, three roses inside a circle, then rest on the school motto: Felix, Fatum, Veritas.\nFortune. Fate. Truth.\nThe answer to Hermes’ riddle. \nI remember him earlier, standing above me, pointing the broomstick: \"Where do you need to go,\" I hear Hermes quizzing me, \"to find fortune, fate and truth?\"\nTrinity Rose.\nI smile to myself, sleepily. \nWhen I wake up, it’s already dawn. I rustle my hands through my hair, clumsily. Outside the early streets are becoming bright. I stumble toward a coffee shop two blocks away."

          "text": "I’m at Jack’s again. \nThe morning sky is above the buildings. I’m sitting by the large window, with a few minutes before school, my matcha latte on the table. On my tablet, another grasshopper is taking shape.\nThe light outside is delicately white. A bird flutters, perched above the cobblestone street. I hear the door swing open. I look up.\nA boy ambles in, approaches the counter and glances vaguely at the large chalkboard menu. He takes a few steps backward, as if deciding.\nHe orders, then glances at the menu again—there is something interesting about him—and then turns in my direction. \nHe steps toward me. \nInstantly, I’m caught in his gaze. \nOur eyes lock together. I can’t look away. I can’t even move. I sit there, with nowhere to turn. \nWe are both caught. Neither of us can look away. Or even breathe. I can only look in his eyes.\nWhat is happening?\nI can see straight inside of him—through his eyes. We are tied together—in this timeless moment—neither able to go anywhere, or do anything without the other. My body is in shock. I can’t even think.\nI can only look.\nA whole second has passed.\nNeither of us has moved. \nHis eyes are bottomless, clear and open. I feel this moment, exploding all around us. I’m totally exposed. There’s nothing I can do. He can see everything about me—every emotion, every thought. It’s impossible to hide anything about myself. \nThis is what I’ve been waiting for.\nBut I’m not ready. \nFor this.\nA voice inside me shouts: Stop. Look away, close your eyes, blink. You’re too exposed— \nWe can see everything about each other.\nHe can see every flaw I have. But I know if I stop now, this moment—born from total, unexpected opening—will be over forever. In this moment there is no compromise, no protection, no hiding of who I am. We are both, absolutely who we are.\nIn the background, I hear my fear again: don’t let him see you, smile, put on a face. But the moment I do, this moment will end. So I silence the voice and with everything I have—I keep looking into his eyes.\nTwo seconds have passed.\nTwo seconds.\nI’ve never been beyond this. \nNow what?\nI cannot break my gaze. I’ve never felt anything like this. From where he stands, I feel him melting, shattering behind his eyes. Somehow he knows me. I don’t know how—but he knows me. We are riding some gigantic wave together, some magnetic wormhole or supernova explosion of a star. All I can do is match his gaze.\nThree seconds.\nI am about to break.\nNeither of us has moved. Neither has blinked. The entire world has come to a stop. No sounds, no movement. Only deep amazement and truth. \nAnd love.\nHow is this possible? \nAlready I feel I love him. There is no doubt, no decision. I love him with all of myself, for all my existence. I can feel his eyes inside of me, reaching me. We are connected, like leaves on the same branch.\nFour seconds.\nI’ve never felt such happiness. His eyes touch mine, so tenderly. It’s a way I’ve never been touched. \nHow can this be? \nI don’t blink or breathe, but I am beginning to see details now, peripherally. He is wearing blue, a sweater or shirt, jeans maybe. I hear the clack of the barista. I’m reminded where we are. \nFive.\nEvery second binds us together. We are two particles racing together at maximum speed, bound only by the delicate bond of love. I am beginning to awaken from this trance. I am suddenly curious: Who are you? What does this mean? Are we bound together forever? A thousand curiosities wash over me at once. \nAnd yet I don’t dare speak. \nI don’t dare break this connection, this place of perfect understanding. \nBut it’s time. \nOne of us has to say something. His eyes are burning into mine. Now it’s time to speak. \nNow it’s time.\nSix seconds.\nHe says:\n\"Hello.\"\nI don’t say anything at all.\nHis eyes say volumes, and then I say: \n\"Hi.\"\nHe steps closer.\nWe are still in the timeless space.\n\"Are you…drawing?\"\n\"Yeah—\" I pause. \"I am.\" \nHe glances at my drawing, and our gaze is broken for the first time.\nHis eyes return to mine. It’s the same silence, the same depth, even though we’ve spoken.\nI push the tablet toward him.\n\"It’s a grasshopper.\"\nHe looks at the drawing and me, at the same time. He is absolutely beautiful.\n\"Oh—that’s good,\" he smiles. \n\"Thanks—\"\nNeither of us knows what to say. This is the first important moment of my life. That’s all I know.\nI force myself to say something, anything.\n\"I’m into drawing,\" I say. \"It’s my thing.\"\nHe looks at me.\n\"I make clothing,\" he adds, clumsily.\n\"Oh.\"\nWhat is there to say? We already know everything about each other. And yet we know nothing! \nMy alarm sounds off. \nWe both look quickly at my phone, and the spell is broken. \n\"Oh,\" I say, reminded of a meeting with Lauren. \"I’m late for something—at my school.\"\nI begin gathering up my things, but something feels wrong. This isn’t how it’s supposed to end. I should say something, but I can’t think of anything. Do I ask his name? His phone number? That feels completely off. I need to say something, but I don’t know what to do.\nI’m getting up from my table. \nHe looks at me. He feels the same thing. Neither of us wants to part. But we don’t know what to say. \nWe’re together and being pulled apart.\n\"Which school?\" he asks.\n\"Trinity.\"\n\"Trinity?\" he repeats.\nI am walking toward the door. He follows beside me, but our eyes are no longer meeting. We exchange a glance, nervously. I don’t know what to do.\n\"Well,\" I smile quickly, \"bye.\"\nHe says, \"bye.\""

The girl in the green shirt is walking away, up the block, below the buildings in the light. \nI stand alone inside of Jack’s. From behind me, I hear the barista call out: \n\"Latte—\"\nI’m awakened from my stupor. \nI’m no longer paralyzed. I step outside, into the busy sound of the street. I head quickly for the corner where the girl in green was going, searching up and down both sides of the street.\nBut I don’t see her.\nAnywhere.\nI’m at the corner, looking everywhere. What a fool I was! To let her just walk away? But wait! I see a flash of green, disappearing around another corner.\nI’m passing people on the sidewalk. They turn toward me, whirling and jumping aside. \nI don’t care.\nI round the corner. \nThere! I see her green shirt, through the traffic ahead of me. I’m running, dodging cars in both directions. The sun is blinding my eyes. I catch another glimpse of green, then lose it behind a bus. When the bus finally passes, the girl in green has disappeared. \nAgain.\nI swivel left and right, madly.\nThere are cars and people in every direction. I focus on every face, near and far. \nNo, no, no, no.\nI can’t lose her now.\nI pick a direction, starting to run. Immediately I stop, then change direction. It’s been seconds since I’ve seen her. \nI am losing her trail. \nOh, there! \nUp the stairs to the High Line, I see her green shirt in the sunlight. I step blindly into the street—a car slams its brakes, the driver glaring at me. I dodge a taxi, a bicyclist and I’m running toward the stairs. Pigeons scatter, as I dash through their wings. \nI’m running like a madman. \nUp the stairs, two and three at once.\nI’m on the High Line. She is ahead of me, not far—on the narrow walking path. I fly after her and coming near, slow my steps and catch my breath, ever so. \nI am almost upon her. \nTwelve steps behind, now seven. \nFive, four, three.\nAnd two…\nShe spins, taking one step toward me. Her hands find my face—she pushes her lips to mine. She is kissing me—we are kissing—and the High Line and New York City are revolving around us. We are locked together, in a kiss that cannot and will not end. \nShe breaks away.\nShe looks shell-shocked. She takes two steps back, gasping for breath. Then turns, running away.\nI stand there, unbelieving. \nI move, following after her. She rounds a bend, behind two small trees. I am right behind her. She is starting down a flight of stairs. \nI grab her wrist on the railing.\nShe turns, her eyes burning.\nI am spellbound.\nIs this another eternity?\nMaybe.\n\"I’m Ori,\" I say.\nShe breaks free—or I let go.\nThe girl is running down the stairs. She disappears down the stairs, and this time I don’t follow."

I piece the pictures together—the hoodie last night, the person in front of the camera, the presence. He didn’t have his hoodie up. It was the same blue hoodie. \nI’d never seen his face.\nOri? What!\nI am staggering down the street, in a hopeless daze. My life is over—that’s what it feels like. I can’t hold in my emotions. I don’t even know what I’m feeling. Am I crying—or am I laughing? There are tears and I’m wiping them off my cheek. What just happened?! \nWhy am I crying? \nI want to scream. For joy, for my whole life up to now, for something I’ve held inside, that I didn’t even know existed. The power of true love. I’m passing strangers in the street. They’re turning to look at me. They’re not used to seeing someone like this. \nI’ve never been like this.\nEvery sensation is blurring, the sunshine, sounds of traffic, people, buildings and signs. I’m tripping through the New York morning. I don’t hear—and hardly see—any of it. I’m on autopilot. What I’m feeling inside makes all of New York seem like a dot, a 10-watt bulb, a mirage, a daydream.\nA star is exploding inside me. \nDid I kiss him?\nI did.\nMemories of the last minutes flash over my eyes. I am overwhelmed with joy. The kiss, the kiss, the coffee shop—I was drawing, and then—our eyes. What was that? No, really—what was that? In that instant, those seconds, that eternity—Agnes Zhu was destroyed. \nI was born.\nDo I even know what he looks like?\nYes. Exactly.\nI must still be crying, because an older man in a grey shirt is approaching me. He’s asking if I’m okay. I nod, say yes, I am. I feel my face, wet with tears. \nOh, Lauren—you’re not going to believe this!\nI’m not afraid of anything anymore. I just died a million times, in a span of six seconds. What’s left to be afraid of? I have total confidence in myself. And in love. I was born moments ago. All that came before—myself, Hong Kong, my parents—was like a passing dream.\nI stop a cab, get in.\nI message Lauren:\n\"Coming.\"\nThe daylight scatters the morning as we drive. I’m replaying the kiss in my mind. I stepped out of character. I was drawn to him. Something came over me that’s never happened before. \nI feel I’m on ambrosia.\nIt’s like a wave of bliss. Everything is beautiful in the streets and New York buildings, in my life. I still can’t believe what’s happened. I’m thinking of him—of Ori—and smiling so hard right now. I’m giddy, laughing, alive. The sunshine sparkles on the cars in the street. The taxi I’m in speeds through an intersection—I see a blur to my right—as a black SUV smashes straight into us. "

I see everything moving at supersonic speed—and in slow motion. I can see the crosswalks. I see the faces of the pedestrians, other cars in the intersection, the traffic light, still yellow. The bomb is still exploding.\nImpact.\nSomething strikes my head, hard.\nMy taxi—with the SUV pinned to its side—slides to a stop at the edge of the intersection. People around us stand shocked, then begin rushing toward us.\nI can’t tell. I lost consciousness long ago."

Could anyone actually survive that? I’m seeing it all from an extremely wide angle. The street is strewn with wreckage.\nBroken glass and metal. \nSeconds are passing. There are sirens, police cars. There are three or four, blue and white lights flashing. The street is closed down, people stare horrified from the sidewalks. A firetruck and ambulance arrive. They are pulling someone from the wreckage.\nIt’s me.\nI should be scared—so scared right now. \nBut I’m not there. \nI’m watching it all from above.\nThe ambulance is racing through the streets. There’s a desperation in the way they’re driving. All the traffic is moving out of the way, they’re running red lights, driving through the street. I’m lying on a stretcher, I’m strapped down and my head is in some kind of plastic brace. My face is blank, and my eyes are closed. \nI’m not moving.\nAnd now something else is happening. Oh my God–what is this? It’s like time has stopped, or stretched out—or doesn’t exist anymore. No, it’s overlapping. Time is overlapping. The ambulance is driving, but I— \nI am lying on my back, dressed in white.\nI’m no longer in the ambulance. The streets of New York have disappeared. I’m on my back, motionless. All around me it’s cold.\nAnd dark. \nBeneath me is a hard slab. I can’t open my eyes. I lie there, unable to move, dressed in white. \nSomeone is coming near me.\nIt’s Ori—\nOh my God, oh my God.\nWhat is this?\nI can see Orion standing over me. My eyes are closed, but I see him from above.\nHe stands absolutely still.\nIt’s Ori.\nBut it’s also not Ori.\nIt doesn’t look like him—but it’s him.\nHis features are different. We are both different—it’s a different place, a different time. It’s the boy I just kissed, from Jack’s Coffee—but it’s a different time. \nI am with him then. \nThe ambulance is driving, red lights flashing. I can see myself, lying in two places at once, the stretcher and the hard slab.\nWith Orion standing over me.\nThere are other images.\nWe’re at my father’s house. It’s a long time ago. We are in the garden. We act different, we look different—my skin is tanned or more olive. My hair is finer and lighter.\nBut it’s us!\nOrion and I are in love. It’s a force so powerful. My father’s house is large and beautiful. My parents are there, but I can’t tell them about Orion. \nOur love is a secret love. \nA tidal wave of memories crashes over me. Orion. \nOrion. \nBut that wasn’t your name—\nYour name was different.\nI see us together in the garden. The pictures are like roses, blooming in my mind. \nMy clothes are elegant and ordinary. It’s day-to-day wear, but it has a handmade grace. I’m wearing a white dress with sleeves of lace. The weather is balmy and warm, even in the nights. The sun feels different here, and yet familiar. Even the earth where I walk feels different. I am somewhere else—in every sensation. I am someone else. And yet it’s also me. \nIt’s who I used to be.\nWe plan to marry, Orion and I. No one can know—our families hate each other. They would never allow it. But nothing matters, compared to our love. \nA priest in a robe is marrying us. \nI have never felt such joy. \nIt’s a holy joy, almost religious, as if something sacred and spiritual has happened. The priest is finished, and we are married before God. \nIt’s a secret wedding. \nWe’re going to wait to tell everyone. There’s a special reason. We hope to bring our families together. We hope our love will set an example.\nWe want to tell them together. \nBut now—turmoil!\nI see other images, other memories. My brother is crazed. Impulsive and violent, he is hardened and filled with hate. He doesn’t trust anyone. He doesn’t understand love. He’s found out about us, somehow.\nHe wants to kill Orion. \nI am living in a nightmare. \nMy brother grabs his sword. He’s leaving to kill Orion. He pushes me aside at the doorway, as I try to stop him. The sun is standing at midday high.\nThere will be death today.\nIn the background, I see the ambulance driving.\nWe are arriving at the hospital. The ambulance is coming to a stop outside the emergency room. The paramedics throw open the rear doors and the driver rushes out. \nThey carry out the stretcher. \nThey wheel me past the hospital doors. I am lying motionless. The medics are pushing the stretcher into one of the emergency rooms. The doctors are there, gathered around me.\nAgain I would be scared. \nBut I’m not there.\nI’m in both places, and neither.\nIn the emergency room and with my brother, as he storms off under the sun. I feel his hate, his sword glinting in the heat. \nI know what happens next. \nNo, no, no!\nMy brother—his sword drawn—has found Orion and his friends. But Orion won’t fight him. He loves me too much. My brother won’t be denied. \nHe attacks Orion’s friend. \nNow, swords fly!\nThey are fighting to the death. Orion tries to stand between them, to restore the peace—but, no—knave, my brother, sneaks an attack and stabs Orion’s friend! He staggers, wounded, laughing, pretending to smile. Everyone is watching. He leans upon Orion, whispering in his ear. Then he stands tall, holds his side and screams in agony: \"A plague on both your houses!\"\nHe falls over, dead.\nNo!\nOrion rushes my brother, blind with rage. The two of them are fighting, neither giving ground. But Orion is possessed—insane with grief and rage. He batters my brother, who struggles to defend himself, until finally—Orion thrusts his sword into him.\nMy brother slumps to the ground. \nHis blood spills into the earth. \nI am grief’s plaything.\nOrion stands in the sun, sword lowered. He kneels by his fallen friend. Our marriage is impossible now. By killing my brother, Orion has broken the law. He will be banned from the city. \nWe can never be together. \nI descend into despair. \nBoth our families are filled with sorrow. \nIn the hospital emergency room, the EKG beeps and flashes. The doctors are watching over me. My face is pale and serene. At my parents’ house, I collapse into my bed. What is worth living for now? I care neither for life nor death. Let it be death. \nIt’s all the same to me!\nMy father is grieving with rage. All the house is weeping and mourning. Orion is gone and I am alone. My mother, the viper, is screaming for Orion’s death. But she’s using a different name.\nThat wasn’t his name.\nWhat was his name?\nEach time I hear her, I grow apart from her. My heart is with Orion, who I’ll never see again. \nI’m with the friar who married us.\nHe’s a good man, devoted to God and Orion’s friend. He gives me a sleeping potion. We’re going to fake my death—and in two days I’ll awaken to be with Orion. It sounds so crazy, but I have nothing left to lose. \nThe friar hands me the vial. \nIt’s sweet to my lips, I drink it down. \nI return home and soon feel dizzy. The world grows slow and heavy, as I slump into bed. \nWhen I awaken, I am lying in the dark. \nMy mind is hazy, I can’t think. I feel cold and wonder where I am. There is someone lying against me. I feel the warmth of their body. Orion, I sigh. The friar’s plan, somehow, it’s worked. Our nightmare is over! I feel a joy unlike any since this ordeal began. My love—my love is with me again. All worldly worries are gone. An unimaginable relief crashes over my soul. I turn to Orion—there is torchlight now, and yet he moves not.\nAwaken, my love.\nOur distance is done. Be with me now.\nOrion lies still and his body limp. What’s this? I spy a vial in his hands. It’s poison to my nose. What? What!? I am struck still.\nHow? How? Why?\nI am gasping, but no breath escapes.\nHave you gone before me, my love, into the everlasting night? And why? And why? No reason. No reason. \nI wail, a sound heard to heaven.\nI hold Orion’s dagger in my hands. It feels sharp as day, pressed against my white dress. I follow you, my love, wherever you will go. In this world or the next, I will be with you. This I vow, before all saints and angels.\nI plunge the dagger into my chest.\nBlackness."

The black cat picks a leisurely path in the sunlight. \nFrom the opposite direction, a boyish young person is approaching. He wears short, dark hair and a loose, black shirt and necklace. \nThe two walk toward each other.\nIn a few strides, they meet. \nThe young person kneels on the stone alleyway, stroking the cat tenderly. It nestles among his legs, then continues on its way. The young person rises up, takes five steps and stops.\nAs if stricken.\nThey brace their left hand along the wall. Then slowly collapse to their knees.\nTheir head bowed, eyes shut.\nOne palm against the wall.\nBreathing.\nIn their heart is a searing pain, mixed together with an excited, guilty pleasure. After many moments, they pull themselves to their feet.\nQuickly they exit the alleyway.\nThey turn toward the Piazza delle Erbe, Verona’s main square. A marketplace of umbrellaed street vendors, fruit stands and tourists lies under a brilliant blue sky. Crossing the stone square, they circle the 700-year-old marble fountain of the Madonna of Verona.\nAt the far end of the square, the young person enters a beautiful, three-story stone palazzo. Bolted onto the wall is a heavy bronze plaque.  It reads:\f\nCapulet\nVerona\n\fInside is a high glass atrium. \nEmployees in red smocks circulate among customers, who examine small perfume bottles and exchange longing glances. On each bottle is stenciled the Capulet logo: a small white dagger.\nThe person in black pays no attention. \nThey move directly to the back of the floor room. Snippets of conversations catch their ears:\n\"It has a very fine head note.\"\n\"And your most expensive fragrance?\"\n\"For today’s woman, mandarin orange and sandalwood signal assertiveness and flexibility.\"\nThe young person approaches an elegant, double wooden door, which automatically slides open. Inside are men and women in white lab coats, busy at their stations. Everyone notices the young person, but no one meets their gaze directly. The young person walks past, up a spiraling, marble staircase.\nTwo stylish employees are descending.\nThey nod and say, \"Maestro.\"\nAt the third-floor landing is a heavy door. The young person clenches their right hand, before reaching out and turning the knob.\nStatues and old books fill the room. \nToward the edge of the room, a wall-sized display comes to life. Appearing on the screen is an elderly Asian man, seated with his hands clasped. The person in black walks directly toward the screen. \nHe raises his eyes.\n\"Juliet is back,\" he says.\nGradually, the older man lifts his eyebrows, leaning slowly forward. \"Are you certain, Tai?\" he says, a mix of curiosity and caution.\nThe young person rubs their right hand. \"Her signature is unmistakable, uncle,\" he says. \nThe older man stares gravely at Tai. \"Do I need to remind you how important this is?\" he says. \"We’ve waited for over five hundred years.\"\n\"Believe me,\" Tai stares back. \"I know.\""

I lift the ends of my blue dress, cutting across the high grass.\nI came as quickly as I could.\nBut I'm already late.\nI reach the overlook, the place we are supposed to meet.

He heads toward a young woman with platinum hair.\n\"Lucrezia—\" he calls ahead.\nThe young woman pretends not to hear. She dabs a thin paper strip into a bottle of red perfume. She waves the paper under the nose of another young technician. His eyes are blindfolded.\n\"Daffodils,\" he smiles.\nLucrezia switches smelling strips, testing a second perfume, this one a slightly deeper red. The young man changes expressions. \nHe appears to be recalling something. \n\"Seashells,\" he says curiously.\n\"Yes,\" says Lucrezia. \"But when?\"\nThe young man concentrates. He swallows. \"On the beach, with my mother. I was twelve, no, eleven—when I was eleven.\" Tai watches the experiment, impatiently, his arms folded. Lucrezia places a third paper strip under the young man’s nose, the deepest red of all.\n\"And this one?\" she asks.\nThe young man inhales deeply. \nAlmost immediately he recoils, his face contorting, as if escaping from the scent. A line of perspiration appears on his brow.\n\"I—I don’t know,\" he answers, nervously.\n\"Didn’t I tell you?\" Tai interrupts Lucrezia’s experiment. \"No negative memories. Who wants a perfume to feel terrible?\"\nLucrezia casts a downward eye. \nThe technician removes his blindfold. Lucrezia puts away the perfume and pats him on the arm. \"It’s okay,\" she says gently. \"You did really well.\"\nShe swivels toward a ruby-colored light, hovering on the tabletop. \"Did you get that, RITA?\" she says. The ruby light wavers in a pleasant, female voice, \"We’re getting closer, Lucrezia.\"\nTai pulls Lucrezia away from the table. \"You and I are taking a little trip,\" he says.\n\"Now?\" she asks.\n\"Adesso—\" Tai repeats loudly, walking away.\nLucrezia glances at her lab table, littered with small glass vials and testing strips. RITA wavers in red, \"Safe travels, Lucrezia.\"\nTai has already disappeared down the hall. Lucrezia rushes to catch him, removing her lab coat. They step into a sun-drenched courtyard. A dark sedan and a driver are waiting for them. \nLucrezia halts. \"Where are we going?\"\n\"New York,\" replies Tai.\n\"Why?\"\nTai meets her gaze.\n\"Juliet is there,\" he says.\nLucrezia stares at Tai, then enters the car. The sedan winds through the narrow, earth-toned Verona streets. Lucrezia sits beside Tai in the backseat. She is silently solving a puzzle in her mind.\n\"Juliet—\" she whispers. \nShe turns to Tai.\n\"But that means—\"\n\"The prophecy is true,\" says Tai, triumphantly. \"Did you ever doubt it?\" \n\"A little—\" says Lucrezia, giddy. \nShe pauses a moment. \"But how do you know?\"\n\"No one has a presence like her,\" Tai looks away. Lucrezia feels eager and anxious at once. \"Now we can finish our work,\" she says.\nTai stares out the window, silently.\nThe sun-colored Italian buildings flash by. Lucrezia looks reflectively at Tai. \"So you never experienced a negative past-life memory?\"\nTai sits stone-faced.\n\"There were a few,\" he says grimly.\nThey enter a hangar near the airport. Tai and Lucrezia stroll toward a small private jet, climbing on board. Lucrezia eases into a plush chair, while Tai chooses the sofa. The plane shreds the runway, breaking the sky.\n\"Where in New York?\" asks Lucrezia.\nTai grins.\n\"You’re going to tell me,\" he says.\nLucrezia looks at Tai, plainly.\nShe reaches into her pants pocket, removing a small glass vial. Inside the vial is a deep blue liquid. Lucrezia gazes into it, mesmerized. \n\"It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backward,\" she says.\nShe holds the vial, chest-height.\nAnd removes the top.\nTakes a breath.\nCloses her eyes. \nAnd immediately begins seeing images.\nThe majestic New York skyline appears, the heavy brown buildings and streets below. Quickly the images accelerate. In rapid succession, Lucrezia sees herself and Tai walking in a white corridor, a man with red-rimmed glasses, an audience standing in applause, Ori kissing Zu on a rooftop, the sharp edge of a knife, cars racing under a black storm, Zu standing under stage lights, Lucrezia’s own face in tears, and finally—an open stage in an empty theater with deep red seats. \nHer eyes open.\n\"It’s a theater.\"\n\"New York is full of theaters,\" Tai admonishes her.\nLucrezia dismisses him.\n\"I’ll find it,\" she insists.\nShe hesitates.\n\"There’s one more thing,\" she says. When Tai doesn’t respond, she says, \"They’ve already met.\" \nTai’s eyes dim like black coal.\n\"But it’s early,\" Lucrezia adds. \nThey face each other intensely, while a well-dressed attendant appears with a silver plate. On the plate are gelato and silver spoons. \nTai helps himself.\n\"I love gelato,\" he relaxes.\n\"So,\" Lucrezia pauses thoughtfully. \"What happens when we find her?\"\nTai waves his spoon in the air, like a playful conductor. His eyes sparkle, darkly. \n\"We bring her home,\" he says."

The room feels cold and sterile, and while Professor Lauren appears calm, she also seems concerned. \nI move my arm. Oh, pain!\nMy body is sore all over. I can’t move a limb without everything aching. \nI suddenly feel scared.\nLauren leans gently closer. In her calming presence, I relax just a bit. Lauren looks at me compassionately, her dark eyes tender. \nI’m so glad she’s here. \n\"You’re okay, Zu,\" she says.\nI don’t say anything.\n\"Your tests came back fine,\" says Lauren. \"They say you can go. I already spoke to your dad.\" \nTests. \nWhat tests?\nAt once I understand: I’m in the hospital. But how did I get here? And why? \nI don’t remember anything. \nI focus on Lauren to ground myself. As if she can make everything alright. A nurse walks into the room. He wears blue hospital scrubs, has short hair and a friendly manner. And a cute smile.\n\"You took quite a hit today,\" he sounds upbeat, which means I’m probably okay. \"You’re a lucky girl.\"\n\"Your family’s out of town?\" he asks.\n\"Yah,\" I say quietly.\n\"Well, it’s a good thing you had Ms. Lauren,\" he says. \"She came right away.\" \nHe winks and pats me on the arm. \nI raise myself gently to a sitting position. I have an IV bandage on my arm. My back and shoulders are stiff as boards. \nI make a twisted face. \nI notice my backpack on the floor, beside my shoes. Something about this jogs my memory. I sit there, remembering the coffee shop—and the kiss. Did that really happen?\n\"Zu, are you okay?\" says Lauren.\n\"Yeah,\" I say distantly, \"I’m fine.\"\nThe nurse returns with a wheelchair. He’s offering me a ride. \"I think I can walk,\" I say.\n\"Take a chance,\" he smiles at me.\nI’m in no mood to argue. I slide into the wheelchair, and we glide through the hospital hallways packed with doctors and patients, going here and there. I’m glad I accepted the nurse’s offer. As we roll through a maze of corridors, I drift back to the morning at Jack’s Coffee.\nIt seems like a dream. \nOr years ago.\nWe exit the sliding glass doors. Outside the humid air greets me immediately. It’s a relief compared to the sterile hospital. Lauren takes over behind my wheelchair. I take a long, deep breath, look around hazily and see an ambulance parked at the curb.\nI’m jolted awake.\nOh God.\nInstantly I remember the ambulance ride. Or rather, seeing myself inside it. \nAnd everything else.\nWas that actually real?\nI must look completely shocked, because Professor Lauren is leaning over me. \n\"Woah, what’s happening?\" she says.\nI can only shake my head.\n\"I just need a minute,\" I say.\nOh my God, it’s all coming back to me. Everything I felt inside—or rather above—the ambulance. Orion, my marriage, my brother and his death—the memories are as real as my life now. \nI don’t know how this is possible.\nBut it’s all completely real. \nProfessor Lauren is giving me space. We’re driving through the city streets. I feel I’m living in two worlds at once. I can’t make sense of it. \nI don’t even try.\nI watch the tall beige buildings of New York City, passing like distant citadels. I’m different now. \nThat’s the first thing I feel.\nI feel older. Or wiser.\n\"What time is it?\" \n\"It’s late afternoon,\" says Lauren.\nProfessor Lauren glances at me. I don’t know what to say, or even how to begin.\n\"Lauren?\" I say.\n\"Yes?\"\nLauren is glad I’m talking.\n\"Something happened. After the crash.\" \nI wait for Lauren to respond. When she doesn’t, I take a breath, hesitate, and say, \"I could see everything that was happening. I was unconscious—but I could see it all, the ambulance, the wreckage, everything.\" \nLauren’s eyes seem to flicker.\n\"And then—\" I pause, unsure if I should continue. \"I started having memories. That I’ve never had before. About someone I met this morning.\"\nI say it all very carefully.\n\"This morning?\" Lauren looks confused. \n\"Ori—\" I say. \n\"You met Orion?\"\n\"I kissed him.\"\n\"You what?\" Lauren turns to me.\nI still can’t get over it. That wasn’t like me. But it gives me a warm feeling, thinking about it.\nLauren’s eyes return to the road.\n\"We had this crazy connection,\" I tell Lauren, as calmly as I can. \"And after the crash—I had all these memories about us. Like we’d already known each other.\" I look over carefully, meeting Lauren’s gaze. \nI couldn’t say this to anyone else. \n\"Is that crazy?\" I say.\n\"What did you remember?\" Lauren asks, earnestly. \nInstantly I feel relieved. \nThis is why I love Lauren so much. I know she believes in me.\n\"Well,\" I say, still in a strange daze, \"it was a long time ago. But it was us. I, we—\" I’m not sure what to say. \"Our families hated each other—so we got married in secret.\" Now I can’t stop talking. \"But my brother hated Orion. He tries to kill him—\" \n\"Orion from school,\" Lauren confirms.\n\"I know, I know—\" I say. \"It’s weird.\"\nLauren listens, patiently.\n\"But Orion kills my brother instead,\" I continue. \"He has to flee the city. We try to be together, but it all goes wrong. Ori takes poison and—I kill myself.\" \nIt sounds so embarrassing, really.\nLauren just stares ahead. I’m afraid to say more, so we drive in silence. \nWe pull into the garage at Lauren’s building. \nI grab my backpack from the trunk. We take the elevator to Lauren’s apartment, on the top floor. Lauren shows me to her bedroom, I take off my shoes and rest a moment on her bed. \nWhen I close my eyes, I’m asleep."

          "text": "I don’t know where I am, again.\nI’m in a room I’ve never been before. The sky is faintly blue outside the windows, but I can’t make sense of my surroundings. For a few moments, I can’t even remember who I am. \nIt doesn’t last for long.\nThe large pillows beneath me bring me back to Lauren’s bedroom. I came in here to lie down.\nA long time ago.\nJudging by the color of the sky.\nI roll onto my side, facing the blue windows. I stay in this position a while. There’s a warm smell of celery and tomatoes drifting on the air. Finally, I shift my legs over the side of the bed.\nSurprisingly, I feel much better.\nAlmost normal again.\nAs if nothing had happened. As if all of today was actually just a dream. \nIt’s a comforting feeling.\nI emerge from Lauren’s bedroom, following the warm smells. I make my way through a softly lit living room and carefully toward the kitchen, where Lauren is standing at the stove. She turns toward me.\n\"Hi, I made soup,\" she says warmly.\n\"I can smell it,\" I smile.\nLauren brings two bowls of vegetable soup into her study. I sit down on the sofa, with Lauren in an upholstered chair and a coffee table between us. Her large dog, Lorenzo, lounges at the base of a ceiling-high bookshelf. \nThe low-lamp warmth of Lauren’s study relaxes me. Lauren brings over a teapot on a bamboo tray, filling our teacups. She crosses the room, retrieving a large book from her impressive bookshelf.\nShe places it on the table.\nIn front of me.\n\"This is the story you told me,\" Lauren says. \"On the way here, in the car.\"\nI look down at the book. On the cover is a scene of two young people on a balcony. The title is Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare.\nI look at Lauren, mute.\nQuickly, I am coming back to reality. I feel anything could happen next.\n\"Have you read it?\" she says. \nI look at Lauren.\n\"No,\" I say.\nI feel a little embarrassed. I fancy myself a storyteller, but I’ve never read Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, only the most famous play of all time. \"It’s a love story,\" I say, trying not to sound ignorant.\nLauren flips open the cover. \n\"You’ve never read it?\" Lauren asks me again. As if she didn’t hear my response.\n\"No,\" I repeat.\nLauren begins turning pages of the book. \"It’s about the Montagues and the Capulets,\" she tells me. \"Romeo is a Montague and Juliet is a Capulet.\" The pages of the book are full of beautiful drawings. \"Their families are feuding,\" says Lauren, \"so Romeo and Juliet can’t be together. They marry in secret.\"\nLauren looks at me.\nI feel unnerved, my stomach clenching.\nI turn the book around, flipping its pages myself. The illustrations are scenes of sword fighting and death, of a priest and two young people being married, and the young girl killing herself with a dagger. \n\"Is this a trick?\" I say, suspiciously.\nThese are the scenes of my memories. But not exactly! It’s like seeing one’s own story—but from the outside in. Like someone else was telling the story. \n\"No, Zu,\" says Lauren, calmly. She edges back from the table, giving me space.\n\"What are you saying?\" I say.\n\"I’m not sure.\"\nFor the first time, I can’t completely trust Lauren. I’m not sure what’s happening. How could this be a trick? Lauren would have had to get inside my memories. At the hospital maybe? And then make a book of it? \nMy mind goes in crazy directions.\nLauren holds my gaze, then slowly draws the book back toward her. \"Can I ask you some questions?\" she says carefully. \"Let’s see what you remember.\"\nI watch Lauren, silently.\n\"Where did Romeo and Juliet meet?\"\n\"I don’t know,\" I say, defensively. \nThis wasn’t part of my memories. I don’t even know anything about Romeo and Juliet, whoever they are—which is actually relieving to me. Maybe this is all explainable, after all.\n\"Okay,\" says Lauren, continuing. She looks down at the page. \"In what city then?\"\nI haven’t a clue. \n\"Verona,\" answers Lauren, and after a pause, \"Italy.\"\n\"Right,\" I deadpan.\nI’m 0-for-2. Somehow this reassures me, like I’m proving my innocence. I would feel cheap if my memories were in any old book. But something happens when I hear the name Verona.\nThe sound has a familiar ring.\nLauren flips another page.\n\"Who married them?\" Lauren looks me in the eye, across the table.\n\"The priest,\" I say. \nI’m uncomfortable knowing this. I mean, you could argue it’s a pretty logical guess. \nExcept I didn’t guess.\n\"Who attended the wedding?\" Lauren asks.\n\"It wasn’t a wedding,\" I say. My certainty is unnerving. \"It was just the three of them.\" \nLauren shifts her position, uneasily. \"And why was Romeo banished from Verona?\" she asks me. \nAgain, I don’t know about Romeo. In my memories, it was Orion who was banished. Does that mean Orion is Romeo? I don’t know. But the sound of the name Romeo stirs my heart.\nDeeply. \nI look down at the floor.\n\"Because he killed my brother,\" I say.\n\"You mean cousin, Zu,\" Lauren corrects me. \"Tybalt is Juliet’s cousin.\"\nI stare at Lauren, vaguely.\nI’m saying the name to myself: \nTybalt\nI look at the image in the book, of the fallen Tybalt. \"No,\" I say, \"he was her brother.\" \nLauren smiles, looking amused. \"Zu, are you saying Shakespeare is wrong?\" \nI raise my teacup, taking a slow sip. I’m surprising myself. I’ve always been confident, but never bold. \"Nothing against Shakespeare,\" I say. \"It’s just that Tybalt is her brother. That’s all.\" \n\"How do you know?\" Lauren sits back.\nShe sounds defensive, like I’ve dared to insult Shakespeare. Now it’s Lauren’s turn to feel uncertain. Even though I’ve known Lauren for a few weeks, this is the first time we’ve talked as equals. \nI say the only thing I can.\n\"I was there.\" \nIt comes out stronger than I expect. \"Tybalt killed Orion’s friend—that’s what started it all.\"\n\"Mercutio,\" Lauren says.\nI feel a shiver up my spine, rising to my neck. Yes, that name feels right.\nI don’t know what rabbit hole this is. \nBut I am in it.\n\"We had a plan,\" I say all at once. \"It was the priest’s idea. I was going to fake my death—but I woke up in the dark in my family’s tomb—and Orion was dead.\" \nIt’s strange to say this and not feel devastated. I’m aware of the devastation, but I’m not devastated. At least not right now. \nThere’s a distance.\n\"And then I stabbed myself.\"\nI feel my strength when I say that. \nThis feels like me. That was pretty gutsy. I’m not sure I’d actually do it again. But I’ve always been able to go for things.\nProfessor Lauren is sitting silently. I feel how much I never want to leave Lauren’s study. Everything else in my life has turned completely upside down. But here with Lauren, I can handle it.\nI sit forward on the sofa.\n\"Lauren, what’s happening?\" I say tensely. \"Why are my memories in Shakespeare’s play?\" \nLauren is uncannily quiet. \nUsually she has an answer for everything. \"Well, let’s remember,\" she says. \"Shakespeare’s play was based on a real story. Romeo and Juliet were real people. Later Shakespeare turned their story into a play.\"\nI desperately want Lauren to say more. \nTo just keep talking. I take another sip of tea, feeling again in two worlds at once. One is hundreds of years old, the other is the present. \nI can feel my memories, impressing themselves, overlapping into Lauren’s study. Even my body feels different. In my memory, I feel slightly smaller—my body is younger and different. And the way I think about things. It’s like I had a different attitude then—a different outlook. I’m more innocent, more religious, but also more aristocratic, somehow more entitled. \nIt’s as if my family, and my family’s social status, were more important then. I’m feeling all this—but at the same time, I’m still myself, Zu. It’s like being inside another person, exploring who they were and getting to know them, without losing touch of myself. I am two people at once. But both of them are really me. \nDifferent sides of me. \nOr different lives of me.\n\"Reincarnation isn’t really accepted these days,\" Lauren breaks the silence. \"But a long time ago, it was.\"\nI’m spellbound. \nI don’t know what Lauren will say next, but I’m hanging on every word. The word reincarnation makes things different. Somehow it feels more real.\n But also scarier and more important. \n\"What you described in the ambulance is sometimes called a time crossing,\" Lauren says. \"When you experience two lives at once.\"\nI listen, rapt.\n\"It’s not so uncommon, actually,\" says Lauren. \"Often what we call deja vu is a weak form of a time crossing.\" Lauren is filling my teacup. \"In the past, reincarnation was accepted as a part of life. It was part of philosophy and religion. In ancient Egypt, Greece and China—past lives were part of being human.\"\n\"What did the Chinese say?\" I’m interested. \nOrdinarily I’d feel completely weird talking about past lives and reincarnation, while Lauren and I calmly sip from teacups. \nBut today has not been ordinary.\n\"There’s a saying in the Zhuangzi,\" says Lauren. \"It’s a famous book of Chinese philosophy: Birth is not a beginning; death is not an end.\"\n\"So you live on—\" I say.\nI hold my breath, unconsciously.\n\"And lived before,\" says Professor Lauren.\nMy heart is actually racing. Anytime I’d heard about reincarnation in the past, it was always like: \"Well nobody really knows, and nobody will ever know.\" But now Lauren is saying that people, wise people—a long time ago—actually knew. Or at least thought they did. \nLauren’s study seems to open wide. Like the room we’re sitting in is bigger than it is.\nMy hands hold my teacup.\nI feel another round of memories could come crashing through, at any time. As if the boundary between the past and the present has been broken.\nNow there’s nothing stopping the flow.\n\"Rebirth is a big part of Hinduism too,\" Lauren goes on. \"There are a billion Hindus in the world. And Buddhism. That’s how they pick the Dalai Lama.\"\n\"What’s the point of it?\" I ask directly.\nLauren seems as interested as I am. \"Well, the Greeks thought it was about perfection—and immortality—of the soul. Basically we learn from our mistakes. So over many lifetimes, hopefully, we become more and more—\" she reflects a moment, \"ourselves.\"\nWow, I think: immortality. \nEven the word has weight. I can’t remember being so fascinated by anything. I had no idea Lauren was this interesting.\nI’m on the edge of the sofa.\n\"So, why isn’t it a thing?\"\nLauren laughs. \"Well, people stopped remembering their past lives,\" she says. \"Also—it got banned.\"\nBanned!\n\"By who?\"\n\"The Emperor of Rome,\" Lauren says casually. What I’m hearing is stranger and stranger. \"About fifteen hundred years ago. His name was Justinian. He knew that ideas have power, so he banned any ideas he found threatening. Justinian decreed that anyone believing in reincarnation would be excommunicated from the Church—which, at the time, was the worst thing that could happen to you.\"\n\"Why was reincarnation threatening?\" I can’t stop asking questions now. \n\"It’s about power, Zu,\" says Lauren. \"Imagine if people didn’t live in fear of death. If they knew they’d be born again. If they knew they’d come back. That would make them harder to control. Justinian and the Church had all the power—and they wanted to keep it that way.\"\n\"Lauren?\" I say, summoning my courage. \"Do you think I actually might have been Juliet?\" \nLauren considers my question, carefully.\nI am hit with a sudden thought. Immediately I stop caring all about philosophy. \nI have a bigger question.\n\"Do you think he knows?\" I say.\n\"Who?\" says Lauren.\n\"Orion.\" \nI can see Lauren doesn’t get it. \nShe hasn’t made the jump—that Orion is, or might be, Romeo. She’s only been considering my story. \"Do you think he knows he’s Romeo?\" I say.\nI’m struck by a terrifying thought. \nWhat if Ori doesn’t know? What if he actually doesn’t remember? What if I’m the only one? I was the only one in the car accident. What would that be like—to have to remember our past alone? \nI imagine how lonely that would be. \nI’m three steps ahead of Lauren. I can tell by the expression she wears on her face. For her, this is still just an interesting case study. An example from her books.\nFor me, it’s my life.\n\"You think Orion is Romeo?\"\n\"Yes,\" I say. \nThere’s not a doubt in my mind. I don’t know where my certainty is coming from. I feel animated, ready to take on the world. \nBut I want Orion with me. \n\"Lauren, I need to see him,\" I say. \"Do you know where he lives?\" \nLauren sits back, abruptly.\n\"Zu, you just got out of the hospital,\" she takes a cautious tone. \"You should stay here.\"\n\"No way—\" I say. \nI’m feeling my newfound boldness. I stand up, pacing through Lauren’s study. \"No way. I need to see him. I’m fine anyway—they said so at the hospital.\" I feel a dizzy wave and catch hold of a nearby chair. \n\"Lauren, this is important,\" I steady myself. \"Where does he live?\"\nLauren hesitates again. Obviously, she knows. So why won’t she tell me? \"What’s with you and Ori anyway?\" I say. \"I heard you were close.\"\n\"We were,\" Lauren says, honestly.\n\"So what happened? You’ve never even mentioned him.\"\n\"I gave Orion some advice—\" Lauren says, haltingly, \"that he didn’t like.\" \nI feel there's more to the story.\nBut that can wait.\n\"Where does he live?\" I ask again. \nI feel like I’m pulling teeth, but I don’t care. Lauren responds: \"We’re not really supposed to give out student addresses.\"\n\"Lauren—\"\n\"71 Gansevoort Street,\" she relents.\n\"Ganzi—what?\" I ask. I hold out my phone, in front of her face, interrogation-like. \"Ganzi—what.\"\nLauren looks at my phone, awkwardly. \n\"Share your location with me,\" she bargains. \"In case you pass out in the street.\"\n\"Deal,\" I say.\nI tap on my phone.\nThen extend my arm again.\n\"71 Ganse-voort,\" Lauren deadpans. The location appears on my map. \nIt’s not even that far!\nI grab my backpack, rushing out the door.\n\"Zu wait—\"\n\"I’m fine, Lauren, I promise,\" I dash down the hallway. I feel Lauren at her door, watching me. \nOnce I’ve made up my mind, no one can stop me. I watch the floors tick down in the elevator. It’s been five hundred years already. \nI don’t have another hour to waste. \nThe floors keep ticking down.\nI just pray Ori remembers.\nLike I do."

My eyes devour the room at once. Beyond a normal-looking living room is a large studio space, strewn with dresses and other cloth. Everywhere are scraps of fabric, a sewing machine, paper patterns and odd-looking tools. It’s an absolute, wonderful mess. My eyes wander the room, touching every object.\nHermes is standing beside me.\nI’m thinking what to say.\n\"He’s on the roof,\" Hermes says.\nMy heart skips a beat.\nOr two.\nToward the back of the studio, a tall window lies halfway open. It’s clear that’s where I’m to go.

Leaning through the open window, I look outward, then step onto the fire escape."

Below and beyond me are the busy lights and streets of New York City. \nBut there’s no one here.\nI step along the grated, metal walkway, looking down at the ground below my feet. Ahead of me is another flight of stairs, leading up. \nIn the moonlit darkness, I see a figure atop the stairs. I stop where I am, as if any movement would frighten them away.\nIs that Orion?\nMy arms fall limp, my eyes turned up.\nI can see him now, his face in the shadows. I observe him closely. How easily he stands, leaning slightly yet straight, his arms outstretched on the fire escape railing above me. \nHe’s looking out over the city.\nHe doesn’t see me.\nThe way he gazes outward, like the world is his kingdom! Oh dignity, composure—and thought! He appears to me as a prince, an artist, and a knight.\nI fix this impression in my heart. \nAnd now—Orion lowers his head and gazes straight at me. We are only shapes, silhouettes among the shadows, yet somehow our gazes meet and lock. The moonlight is glazing over the empty street below.\nI stop where I’m standing.\nIs it really you? \nThe boy from my memories? Is this you—who I died for, so long ago?\nHe rises up, standing taller.\n\"Orion—\" I speak.\nHe doesn’t move.\nMy shoes are rooted. Neither of us are able to move. I want to scream out. But I can’t make a sound. Or move a bone of my body. \nHe says, in wonder:\n\"Is it you?\"\nMy heart breaks by his voice. \n\"It’s me—\" I cry out. \nThen I say.\n\"It’s Zu.\"\nOrion barely moves, but I feel him staggering. I don’t know what to do or say next. \nSo I stay silent. "

          "text": "What?!\nI stare downward, my hands gripped tightly upon the iron railing. Like my life depends on it. I feel a shock through my entire body.\nOf recognition, and familiarity.\nThe girl is standing below me, on the stairs. Is it her from this morning? \nFool!\nOf course it is! \nBut how? What is she doing here? \nI watch her gazing up at me. The morning at Jack’s comes racing back. Through the moonlight shadows, I see her green shirt and purple hair falling gently on her shoulders, her head raised up. \nShe takes a step on the stairs. \nIf she takes one more, I will burst.\n\"No—\" I warn.\nShe waits.\nI don’t know why, but I am terrified. I have an awful feeling inside me. I hold out my palm. \n\"Don’t come closer,\" I tell her.\n\"Why not?\" she asks, perplexed. \nI haven’t heard a dozen words she’s spoken, but I know her voice. The girl takes another two steps anyway, disregarding me. \nHer gaze is shining.\nWhy am I hesitating? \nI can’t name what I’m feeling. It has a hold over me I can’t explain. Carefully I release my grip on the railing, gazing down.\n\"I’m afraid,\" I say.\n\"Of what?\" \nI have no idea. This morning I followed her through the streets. But now? \"A memory—\" I say. Below, she takes one step closer.\n\"Is it painful?\" she asks.\nI feel an ache in my stomach.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"What is the memory?\" she asks, gently.\nA part of me knows.\nIt’s the part of me that knows my secret. But there’s another part that doesn’t want to know. That is terrified to know. The girl in green is climbing the stairs. She moves nimbly, she is halfway toward me. \nNow I see her face in the moonlight.\nOh, she is beautiful.\nHer eyes are searching mine. She climbs to the top of the fire escape, where I am standing. Then says, meaningfully, \"Do you remember me?\"\nI step back from the stairs.\n\"From this morning,\" I say.\nThe girl frowns lightly, brushing hair from her face. I feel I’ve said something wrong. \"From the coffee shop, right?\" I make it even worse.\n\"That’s all?\" she replies.\nWhat does she want me to say? \nSomehow, I know I should know. But I don’t know! I step backward clumsily, nearly tripping over my feet. This is so unlike me. \nWhat am I afraid of? \nI’m enchanted with her. \nBut all I want is to escape.\n\"So you don’t remember?\" she asks again.\nWhat is she actually asking me? But already, I know. This is about last year. And whatever was supposed to happen. This is about my memories, the ones I can’t unlock. The ones I can’t remember.\nBut how can she know?\nI fumble my words. \"I don’t—\"\n\"No,\" she says, sadly, \"you don’t.\" \nHer gaze is pained.\nI am backing to the edge of the fire escape. The girl in the green shirt follows. \"Orion,\" she says. How intimately she says my name!\nAs if she’s always known me. \nMy back is pressed against the railing. The girl in the green shirt steps toward me.\n\"Something happened,\" I hear her say, \"after we met this morning. You may not believe me—I’m not even sure I believe myself.\" Our eyes are locked once again, just like this morning. \"But I know you.\"\nSomething is happening.\n\"I know who you are,\" she says.\nWhat does she mean?\nOur gaze is going deeper. I am beginning to feel what I can’t remember. I feel how much I want to remember. And how much I don’t.\nHow terrified I am.\nOf this memory.\nSomething is changing about the night. The rooftop fire escape and the buildings of the city, even the air itself, are beginning to change. \nThey are turning transparent.\n\"Can you remember?\" the girl is urging me. \"Can you try to remember?\"\n\"Zu—\" my voice feels strange. \nThe girl nearly dissolves at her name. She exhales, moving closer to me, until we are almost touching. She raises her hand toward my heart. \nI don’t move. \nI’ve given in to this mystery.\nShe says, \"I need you to remember.\"\n\"How?\" I say.\nI am staring into her eyes. \nSomething inside me is starting to happen. I hear a sound like butterfly’s wings. Our surroundings are continuing to change. Across the street, the brownstone buildings have nearly disappeared. \nZu’s hand is over my heart.\nShe whispers: \n\"My love, my life, my friend—\"\nSomething shatters inside me.\nI’ve heard these words before. But where? A boundary has been broken. The fire escape is rapidly fading away. In its place is a stone balcony with climbing roses and alabaster columns. We’re in both places at once. I see a young girl dressed in white, standing before me. She speaks to me, passionately:\n\"I must hear from thee every day in the hour,\nFor in a minute there are many days.\"\nWe’re in two places at once. On my New York rooftop, Zu holds my heart. On the stone balcony, the girl in the white dress goes on:\n\"By this count I shall be much in years\nBefore I behold my Romeo again.\"\nRomeo!\nThat’s my name.\nMy name is Romeo.\nThe girl in white leans on the balcony, her bare feet brushing the terra cotta tile. I reach for her, twisting my hands in her hair. Beyond us lies the new, green night. The girl looks different.\nBut she’s the same person.\nThe same as Zu.\nI am a boy. I am younger, but remind me of myself. I say, confidently:\n\"I’ll miss no chance to send you my love.\"\nI’m in love—as in love as any human being, ever. I’m captured by the girl in the white dress, my eyes brilliant.\nShe blossoms:\n\"Do you think we’ll meet again?\"\nI reply, boldly:\n\"I have no doubt. This will give us stories to tell each other, in times to come.\"\nI say:\n\"Farewell, Juliet.\"\nJuliet!\nThe girl’s name is Juliet.\nHow the sound wrenches my heart!\nOh, everything is coming back.\nOn the fire escape, Zu holds my heart. Neither of us move, as if frozen in time. I’ve surrendered to whatever is happening. On the stone balcony, the girl in the white dress inches toward me.\nShe kisses my lips.\nAnd I hear the butterfly’s wings.\nThe delicate sound explodes inside me. New York and the fire escape have completely disappeared. The stone balcony has disappeared. I am moving rapidly and deeply inside myself, memories are flashing across my mind. I am disintegrating into memories. I am nothing but memories. Time has slowed to a stop. I am surrounded by images and memories. The girl in the white dress remains, her lips brushing mine—and then she also disappears.\nNow I see horses.\nI am riding on a white charger. Beside me, Juliet sits astride a spotted stallion. \nWe are emerging from a forest, riding hard, the countryside flattening in front of us. Our horses thunder  and pound the ground.\nWe splash in a stream, down rows of a vineyard. I feel the horse’s hooves beneath me, as the sunshine arcs in the sky. Juliet wears a long green dress, white trim embroidered on the breast. I have taught her to ride. It’s the only way we can be together. We are happy and excited, the vineyard rows disappearing beneath us as our horses leave the earth behind.\nThis is love. This is life.\nNow the scene is changing. \nIn the garden, it’s late afternoon and the gold light is falling over the flowers. Juliet is smelling them, as usual. My shirt is torn, we mend it together. Juliet is teaching me to sew. I look in her brown eyes, watching her thread and needle, looping around and around. \nBut I learn too slow. \nShe teases me, as I stare into her eyes. Neither of us knows what to do. \nWe are young. \nNow someone is coming. We hear their voices. I dash away through the garden.\nA dozen more images arrive in my mind. An elegant portico in the sun. I am well dressed and young, my father, my mother, my friends—and this girl—Juliet, love of my life. I have never known such joy and happiness. Sunny, sunny images, the sun and the golden land, a love of clothing and cats. The images flood my memory, one after another, flashes and insights, like a trove of photos forgotten forever and only found again. The memories are arriving, a dozen a second, overwhelming my ability to process what is happening.\nI am sitting in a field with Juliet. \nAround us is the green grass, the forest further away. We are facing each other.\n\"And you promise?\" she says, seriously.\n\"I’ll never lose you.\"\nI reach out, taking her hand. In that moment, a green grasshopper lights upon her finger. \nWe watch its eyes together.\n\"It’s an omen,\" I say.\nShe blushes.\n\"If you lose me, you’ll find me,\" she smiles.\n\"I’ll find you,\" I say.\nThe green grasshopper flies away.\nWe walk across the field, toward our horses. The green grasshoppers are flying across the field, sheltered by the gold light of the sun.\nI promise, I promise.\nI promise."

They don’t approve of me, a Montague, but tonight there is nothing they can do. I absorb Juliet’s every detail, the way she moves, the braids of her hair, the touch of her finger, the flesh of her shoulder.\nWe draw apart from the crowd.\nIn the commotion of the evening, no one notices us.\nIn this moment, my life changed course.

          "text": "I awaken late in the night. \nMy first thought is: I’m back at home, stretched out under my duvet blanket. But something about the room smells different. I roll on my side and see Orion sleeping across the bed. The moonlight is falling on his face.\nSo it wasn’t a dream!\nI rest my eyes on Orion, letting his presence sink in. He looks so blissful sleeping. \nLike a thousand year sleep.\nI don’t dare wake him. \nI glance around in the grey darkness. The large room feels both foreign and comfortable. I slip over to Ori’s workspace, where scraps of fabric and a few photos are pinned on a cork board. \nI quietly click on a small desk lamp.\nI lean closer, examining the photos. \nThere’s one of a younger Ori with his family, another of Ori standing in a desert background, and a few photos of the desert itself. I spot something else, partially hidden beneath some paper. \nIt’s a driver’s license. \nI can’t resist. \nI slide it carefully from under the paper. In the photo, Orion is looking at me, smiling casually. I read the name on the card.\n\"Orion Moore,\" I say silently.\n As if I’m learning a secret. \nI replace the license where it was.\nOn my phone, I see a message from Lauren:\nAre you okay?\nI reply:\nYes\nI found him\n❤️\nI step backward, then turn around slowly, as if someone’s presence is behind me. In the middle of the room is the white dress. \nIt stands like a ghostly figure.\nI’m struck seeing it. I cross the room, stopping a bit before it. I recognize it from my memory of the tomb. I feel I’m looking at myself in the mirror.\nIt’s not exactly the same. \nBut it’s close.\nWe stand there, the white dress and I, facing each other. Like long lost friends, or twins. In the moonlight, I contemplate Ori’s creation.\nWhat he must have imagined!\nTo make this.\nA sudden banging jolts my reverie. At once, the banging is all through the studio. My head spins around, looking for the noise. \nI can’t find the source of the sound. \nBut it’s so loud! \nIt comes in loud explosions of five: \nBam, bam, bam, bam, bam!\nThen silence. Then again.\nBam, bam, bam, bam, bam!\nI don’t know whether to hide or cry. Now I realize it’s coming from the door to the apartment. Someone is knocking—no, pounding—on the door. Again, louder: Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam! I hurry and approach the door. Whoever is outside does not feel nice. \nBut I don’t have a choice. \nThe banging won’t stop until I open the door.\nI make my way slowly toward it. My bare feet cross a patch of moonlight on the floor.\nNow the entire room is shaking:\nBam, bam, bam, bam, bam! \nThe banging is inches away. I place my fingertips on the cold brass handle. I summon my courage, then open the door. The banging stops.\nOh. What? \nThere’s no one there. \nBut that’s not what’s strange. \nOn the other side of the door, there’s not even a hallway. I’m standing in the doorway of Ori’s studio. But on the other side is a stone courtyard in the moonlight.\nNo, I look again.\nIt’s not a courtyard, it’s the square of an old city.\nI smell jasmine, moss and old cobblestones in the warm, night air. The rich scents waft through the doorway. I see a tall stone statue and a fountain. Now I recognize this place. From my memories.\nThis is Verona.\nI contemplate if I should step through. That feels completely reckless, and more than a little dangerous. I could just close the door, right?\nBut I can’t turn back. \nBesides, I’m way too curious.\nCarefully, I extend my bare foot forward. My toes touch the cool cobblestones of the square. It’s the Piazza delle Erbe, Verona’s main square. I know it well. \nMy first sensation is: I’m home. \nIt’s a wave of relief, a feeling of safety. Like I belong here. I’ve missed it so much—without even knowing it. I move forward, more relieved with every step. I make my way toward the fountain. I remember: I used to play here with my friends. I remember us splashing in the water and laughing. \nI’m standing by the fountain.\nHere in the Verona moonlight, I am Juliet Capulet again. I am no longer Agnes Zhu. She has not even been born. New York doesn’t yet exist. I look down at my arm. There’s no bandage now. I’m wearing a plain white dress, with short lace sleeves.\nAnd I’m not alone.\nStanding at the end of the square, in front of a three-story palazzo, is a gang of dark figures. Their faces are shrouded. One of them, wearing a heavy cloak and hood, stands in front of the others. In the background are twenty or thirty more, men and women. \nI can only see their shapes.\nThe leader raises his left arm, slowly, until his gloved finger points at me.\nSomething tells me to turn around. \nBut before I’ve taken a step, a second group of figures appears behind me. I’m trapped in the square between them. \nAnd I know who they are.\nThey’re Capulets.\nI’ve left them. Now they want me back.\nThe two groups are surrounding me. I retreat in one direction, only to reverse in the other. Soon I’m trapped against the fountain. The dark figures encircle me. They smell like cold, wet steel. I hear the shuffling of their feet, amid the splash of the fountain. I still can’t see their faces. But they’re almost upon me. \nI have nowhere to go.\nFrom behind, two of the figures grab my arms, one on each side. A shock of terror, like electricity, crosses my skin. Their grasp is bony and hard. \nThe leader, in the heavy cloak, strides forward coldly, reaching out his gloved hand. But before he can grab me, a bluish white light ruptures the sky.\nEveryone stops where they are. \nThe bony hands release their grasp. Now even the fountain is silent. The heads of the dark figures—and my own—all gaze skyward in awe. \nThis light cannot be ignored. \nThe bluish white light is descending into the square, over every head and building and stone. The Verona night sky is filled with light."

          "text": "I wake up with a rush.\nI’m on the couch, in Orion’s bedroom. Daylight is wafting in through the curtains. There’s no fountain, no blue white light in the sky.\nNo one is trying to grab me.\nAcross the room Orion lies asleep, the sunlight catching his wavy hair. \nI inch over toward the bed, crawling onto the bedcovers, beside Orion. I want to know this is real and not another dream. I peer over his shoulder, carefully watching the rise of his breathing. Outside the window, a brown starling flutters on the fire escape. \nOrion blinks open his eyes.\nAgain we’re caught.\nHe’s looking at me, a combination of searching and uncertain. But also with absolute trust. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so trusted. By anyone.\nIt touches me, deeply. \n\"You’ve been sleeping,\" I say gently. \"I think it’s normal after—\" I’m unsure what to say next, \"remembering. I was out a long time too.\" I leave out being in the hospital, which feels complicated.\nOrion looks as if I might vanish. \n\"Oh,\" he says, vaguely.\nHe rests himself on his elbows, his t-shirt pulling at his shoulders. At the hospital, it wasn’t until I saw the ambulance that everything came back. I wonder if Orion is going through something similar. \n\"What—\" he tries to speak.\n\"It’s called a time crossing,\" I say. \"It’s two lives at once. That’s what Lauren says.\" \n\"Lauren?\"\nOrion shuts his eyes, like he’s remembering. \nThen he says, \"I thought you were dead.\" I don’t know what he means. \"In the tomb—\" he says painfully. \"I thought you were dead.\"\n\"I was sleeping,\" I say achingly.\nFive hundred years of grief flood through me. \"It was a sleeping potion,\" I say. \"You were supposed to wake me!\" \n\"Sleeping?\" says Orion.\nHis gaze is devastated, trembling. He presses his palms on his forehead. My heart is bottoming out, into a dark, endless pit. How do you survive what happened to us? How do you survive the ultimate tragedy? \nWhen death is not the end, there’s only one choice. \nYou have to feel it. \nEvery last bit.\nI’m about to lose it, completely. I take Orion’s head, holding him between my hands. I hold him there with everything I have. \nIt’s the simplest, most honest thing I can do. \nThere’s nothing to not understand.\nI feel Orion melting, breathing deeply. He looks up toward me sideways. Again that feeling of total trust that burns right through me. How do I express what I’m feeling? Infinite gratitude? Infinite thanks? My love of loves—who I thought I had lost forever—is with me at my side. This is the greatest gift in the world.\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" I whisper.\nI’m not sure who I’m thanking. \nIt doesn’t matter. Ori clutches at me intently. I feel his warmth and smell his hair. He touches my arm, where I have the bandage. \n\"What happened to you?\" he asks.\n\"I was hit by a car.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Not me—my taxi,\" I explain. \"That’s how I remembered. The accident triggered it. It was after kissing you,\" I add, smiling without embarrassment.\n\"You were hit by a car?\" Orion repeats, like that’s the most incredible part of the story. He looks worried, as if maybe I might just die again.\n\"Really, I’m fine,\" I say.\nI’m not sure he believes me.\n\"Were you with me?\" he asks. \"Last night—with everything that happened.\"\nMy eyes look him over.\n\"Yeah,\" I say.\nI watch the brown starling, fluttering on the fire escape. Everything feels raw in this moment. I feel I’m at the beginning of a completely new life. But it’s also tied—or bound up—with the past. \nFor better or for worse.\n\"What is it?\" Ori asks, sensing me.\nHe knows me too well.\n\"I had a dream,\" I answer him. I don’t really want to talk about it, especially now. But I can’t keep it a secret. Not from Orion. \"I was back in Verona. There was an angry mob,\" I tell him, as I remember it. \"They were angry I’d left them. They wanted me back.\"\n\"Who were they?\"\n\"My family.\"\nOri just stares at me, digesting my words.\n\"The Capulets,\" I say.\nI try to sound calm, but I’m still unnerved. I remember how real the palazzo felt, the stones and the fountain. I consider telling Orion about the ending of the dream. About the mysterious blue light in the sky. But I decide against it. I don’t even know what it means. \nIf anything.\n\"It was just a dream,\" I shrug.\nI gaze around the room. On Ori’s nightstand is a sitting Buddha and a couple candles. \nMy phone is ringing.\nOh, not again.\nOn the screen, I see Lauren's face. Sorry Lauren, not now—I can’t. I swipe decline. \n\"Was that—\" Ori looks over.\nBefore I can answer, I see a message from Kimmo: \"Are you coming today?\" What is she talking about?\nOh! \nThe rehearsal. For The Lights. \nWith Landon.\nIt feels like ancient history to me. I’m already late and I consider blowing it off. But I can’t. And besides, I actually want to be there.\n\"It’s my friend, Kimmo,\" I tell Orion.\nI wonder if he knows her. She knew him. So many questions swirl in my head. How did Orion and I end up at the same school? \nAnd why didn’t he stay? \n\"We’re rehearsing a sketch for The Lights,\" I say. \n\"Really?\" Ori sounds interested. \nI realize Orion doesn’t know anything about my actual life. Or I about his. \nI’m quickly gathering up my things. \nIn my haste, I drop my backpack, spilling my pencil and tablet on the floor.\nOrion casually picks up the tablet. On the screen is my drawing of the boy from my imagination. The one from the ferry on Victoria Harbour.\nBoth of us are awestruck.\n\"This looks like me,\" Ori says.\nWe’re both speechless. It’s just a rough sketch, but there’s an uncanny likeness. His hair has a similar quality, and I’ve captured something of his cheekbone. And the way his eyes gaze forward. \nLike he’s looking into the future.\nBut more than anything, it’s that I feel him in my drawing. \nI take a long, deep breath. This is all so surreal. \"Why don’t you come with me?\" I say.\nIt’s a brilliant idea.\n\"To school?\" Ori answers. \"No.\"\n\"Why not?\"\nI look at him.\nHe doesn’t answer.\n\"Okay,\" I decide. \"I’ll come back.\"\nOrion’s eyes are piercing, as if we never had a day apart. As if Verona was only yesterday. He removes the red yarn bracelet from his arm. \nHe slides it down my wrist. \n\"So you don’t forget me,\" he smiles. \nMy heart is open.\n\"No more accidents?\" he says.\nI smile.\n\"I promise.\""

Or with new eyes.\nI watch a middle-aged woman with glasses, reading on a device. A man in a grey business suit sits beside her, a leather case on his lap. In the aisle are two teenagers on their phones, earbuds in. \nI’m surprisingly fascinated. I am seeing these people from an entirely new angle.\nWho were they in their last life?\nThey must have been someone. If I had a past life, that means everyone had a past life. Everyone.\nAs in everyone. \nEveryone comes back. \nIt wouldn’t make any sense, if only Orion and I reincarnated. Isn’t that what Lauren said? In the past, people knew they reincarnated.\nMy mind short-circuits, spontaneously blown. I think to myself: it’s like everyone is walking around with amnesia. About their past. \nI was too—until yesterday. My whole idea of life is being flipped on its head. I’m imagining an entire planet of people—eight billion of us—walking around with amnesia about who we used to be. \nWho we are. \nWoah.\nI’m staring at the man in the business suit. Who were you in your last life? Were you a man or a woman? When did you live? In what country? \nWere you white or black or Asian? \nWhat was your life like? Did you have a family and children? Did you grow old?\nOr was your life cut short?\nLike mine.\nI’m noticing his every detail. The way he holds his briefcase tight, his slightly slumped posture, the way his head leans to one side. \nWere you loved? I wonder.\nLike I was?\nI am overcome with quiet empathy. I don’t know the businessman sitting across from me. But I can feel the human parts of him. He’s had triumphs and tragedies. Just like I have. He’s known hopes and disappointment, love and loneliness. \nJust like I have. \nIn so many ways, he’s like me.\nI glance from the businessman to the two teenagers, then the middle-aged woman and the other passengers aboard the train. I am thinking of everyone in New York City and all their forgotten pasts. \nWhy doesn’t anyone remember? \nI ask myself: Is this some kind of conspiracy? Is it only Orion and myself? Only us, awakened in the world.\nOr are there others?\nMy thoughts race ahead of me.\nI can’t keep up. There’s a universe of questions I’ve never even considered. What happened to my family from the past? Where are they now? What happened to my father and mother and brother?\nI feel so grateful for Orion. For second chances. \nFor memory. \nWhat if everyone on this train could feel what I am feeling now? If they all remembered their pasts? \nThat would change their lives. \n\"Can I help you?\" the businessman says to me.\nHe’s caught me staring. \n\"Oh, sorry—\" I say, embarrassed.\nI can’t even imagine explaining. Just be thankful, I tell myself. Just be thankful. I twist my fingers around the red yarn on my wrist.\nI am thankful."

          "text": "Above ground, I head for the theater. The final rehearsals for The Lights are at a large performing arts center next to Washington Square Park. It’s where The Lights will take place.\nI walk a few blocks, then enter the theater. \nImmediately my skin tingles. \nI’ve always had a feeling of reverence for the theater. It’s especially easy in this beautiful one, with its black railings and brilliant red seats.\nI start toward the stage. \nI’m actually only a few minutes late. \nA group of students are on stage, with Landon and Kimmo in the center. There are plastic palm trees on rollers on both sides of them, representing a passageway in the Capulet mansion. \nMy steps slow, slightly.\nThe time crossing has changed everything. I can see how this crude scene is modeled on what I actually remember. But it’s so far from reality. \nThe difference is shocking.\nIt’s just a caricature.\nI hear Landon, speaking his lines to Kimmo. She’s standing in for me, I guess. \nHe still isn’t doing it right. Kimmo stands there, like a deer caught in the headlights.\n\"If I profane with my unworthiest hand\nThis holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:\nMy lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\nTo smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\"\nLandon edges toward Kimmo, who backs away. It’s just as bad as the first time. If not worse.\nI break into laughter, loudly. \nUnexpectedly.\nLandon and Kimmo pivot toward me. I walk casually onto the stage. Landon takes two steps toward me, looking annoyed.\n\"Nice of you to show up,\" he says.\n\"Sorry I’m late,\" I greet them.\nKimmo stares at me. \"Where have you been?\" she breaks away from Landon and the plastic palms. I alter my direction slightly, avoiding both Landon and Kimmo—and her question. I move to the edge of the stage, where I drop my backpack.\nKimmo comes over to me.\n\"I met someone,\" I smile quickly.\n\"Tell me—\" Kimmo looks at me, excitedly. I’m about to burst at the seams. I want to tell Kimmo everything. But I restrain myself. \nWhat’s happened is too special. \nI need to guard this, carefully. Also, I have no idea where to start.\nI keep it simple. \n\"I met Orion,\" I tell her.\n\"What—\" she says. \"Ori from Trinity?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"We—bumped into each other.\"\n\"And?\" Kimmo says, eagerly.\nI breathe in deeply, smiling secretly. I wonder how much to share with Kimmo. I know I can tell her anything, but instead, I just look her deeply in the eyes. She picks up on my wordless gaze.\n\"Ohh,\" she says. \nShe doesn’t know what’s happened.\nBut she understands. We share a moment, as I stare vulnerably into Kimmo’s eyes. \n\"Hey Zu—\" Landon calls out. \"Do you feel like joining me today?\" \nI turn around, relieved. \nAs much as I love Kimmo, I’m not really ready to talk about this. I shoot her another glance that says: I’ll tell you later.\nWe both walk over to Landon.\nI take over for Kimmo, standing opposite Landon between the plastic palm trees.\nI feel surprisingly calm. \nLandon focuses, then begins again:\n\"If I profane with my unworthiest hand\nThis holy shrine—\"\n\"Stop,\" I say. \nI can’t let him go on.\n\"What do you mean?\" Landon looks incredulous. \"I just started—\"\n\"You’re making it all about yourself,\" I interrupt him again. I’ve finally figured out his problem. It’s so obvious, now that I have something to compare it with. My actual memories. \"It’s not about you.\" I can see Kimmo smiling at me, behind Landon. \n\"It is about me,\" Landon says. \n\"No, it’s about me,\" I reply. \nHearing my words makes me shiver. I’m not used to hearing myself speak this way. So boldly.\nI step toward Landon.\n\"Look, Landon—\" I explain. I close my eyes a second, gathering my thoughts. \"This is about how Romeo is feeling. Of course. But what he’s feeling is about Juliet. So I need to feel that in your lines.\"\nLandon listens, grudgingly.\n\"Do you want to try again?\" I ask.\nLandon inhales, then backs up slowly. He is staring at me, cautiously.\nHe begins:\n\"If I profane with my unworthiest hand\nThis holy shrine—\"\nIt’s better.\n\"—the gentle fine is this:\nMy lips—\"\nIt’s getting worse, again. \n\"Look into my eyes,\" I direct Landon. \"Not at my eyes, into my eyes.\"\nLandon raises his chin, doing what I say.\n\"Two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\nTo smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\"\nLandon is looking in my eyes now. This is actually improving.\nThere is a brief silence—\nOh! I realize it’s my turn.\nI say:\n\"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\nWhich mannerly devotion shows in this;\nFor saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,\nAnd palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\"\nThe words roll off my tongue. Landon’s jaw drops, as he listens. I see Kimmo staring at me, as well. \nLandon snaps back into character:\n\"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\"\nI cringe.\nIt’s not that Landon is especially bad. But when you’ve felt these words for real, hearing anyone else say them falls painfully short. \n\"Maybe—\" I suggest, \"just try being yourself.\"\n\"This is me.\"\nI chortle.\n\"What’s so funny?\" Landon demands.\n\"Well, you’re not Romeo,\" I say.\nI’ve made Landon defensive, borderline furious. \"I don’t see you in The Lights,\" he snaps back.\nGrrrr.\nThis hits a sore spot. He has a point.\nMy lips purse.\n\"Do it again,\" I say to Landon.\nLandon prepares himself, then says:\n\"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\"\nIt’s better, somehow.\nI decide to invest myself. I step toward Landon. I place my hands gently on his shoulders, adjusting his posture. \"Just try—to be more natural,\" I say. Landon exhales. I can feel him loosening up.\nI say:\n\"Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.\"\nI step in a slow circle, around Landon, observing his posture. Landon’s head turns, following me. He says:\n\"O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;\nThey pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\"\nI answer:\n\"Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.\"\nI’ve returned full circle, facing Landon. He looks into my eyes. There is actually real chemistry now.\nLandon draws near, closing the space between us. I smell a mild fragrance, something spice-like. Landon says:\n\"Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.\nThus from my lips—\"\nLandon’s face is inches from mine.\n\"That’s enough—\" I say.\nI place my palm against Landon’s shirt, pushing him gently backward. Landon doesn’t say anything.\nI realize the theater has grown quiet.\nKimmo and the other kids are all watching. Landon also is looking at me in a different way.\n\"Thanks,\" he says.\nI just nod.\nLowering my eyes.\n\"Can we do it again tomorrow?\" Landon asks.\n\"Sure.\"\nI begin walking toward my backpack. Kimmo is observing me. When I reach her, she says, \"Zu, that was really special.\"\nI smile, thinly.\nInside I am processing what happened. It’s the most I’ve ever enjoyed myself on stage.\n\"How did you know the lines?\" \n\"Oh—\" I say, covering. \"From the other day, I guess.\"\nThe group begins breaking up. I can tell Kimmo wants to remain behind to talk to me. But she has a class to get to. \"I’ll find you later,\" she promises me. The others head off quickly as well.\nI have a free period, so I don’t hurry. \n\"No problem,\" I call after them, joking. \"I’ll just clean up here, by myself.\" I feel a warm glow in my heart. What just happened has lit a fire in me. \nIt feels so good."

          "text": "I roll the plastic palms backstage. \nThen I return, collecting the remaining props. As I do this, I gaze out into the empty theater, feeling the stories that are brought to life here.\nIt gives me a sudden chill.\nLike I belong here.\nI pause at the edge of the stage, savoring this. Then I grab my backpack, heading up the aisle between the long rows of red seats. I’m halfway to the exit, when someone grabs my arm.\nFirmly.\n\"Hey—\" I call out, alarmed.\nI whirl about, facing a young Asian person. \n\"Hello Juliet.\"\nI lose all my strength. \nThe young person, dressed in black, is pulling me slowly but powerfully back toward the stage. From their rigid grasp, they feel masculine. But there’s a feminine quality to their face. \nI stumble along in shock.\n\"Can we talk?\" says the young person.\n\"No—\" I say. \nI wrestle their arm, trying to break free. \nI feel their fingers, digging into my flesh. Behind them a young woman with platinum hair gazes at me, in a friendly way. \"Please,\" says the young person, firmly. \"If you care at all about Romeo.\"\nWhat?!\nI lose my strength, a second time. \nA wave of panic courses through me. \nI scan the two strangers desperately. In microseconds I’m debating whether to strike out at them, run for the door or scream.\n\"Let go of my arm,\" I say cooly. \nThe firmness of my voice surprises me. The androgynous young person smiles at me brashly. But releases me. \nHe gestures politely toward one of the red theater seats, where we’re standing. This is my chance to run, but for some reason, I don’t even consider it. \nI glare at them, sitting down. \nStrangely I am not uncomfortable. In fact, I am weirdly comfortable—for being in the company of these two.\nI feel a mix of defiance and fear. \nAnd familiarity.\n\"Who are you?\" I break the silence.\nThe young person in black smiles at me. He’s such an intense looking person. Not exactly good-looking, but intense. His eyes are deep brown verging on black, like dark pools of destruction. Surprisingly his face is almost charming. But there’s something brutal, just beneath the surface. \n\"I’m Tai,\" he says.\nAs if that means something.\n\"Do you know about Capulet perfumes?\" says the platinum woman. \nWait. What?\nWoah.\nI experience one of those zoom-in moments, where everything trivial disappears, leaving you only with what really matters. \nI can only think one thing.\nCapulet.\nOf course I know their perfume. They’re only the most luxurious perfume brand in the world. It’s like asking someone, do you know Versace? Do you know Calvin Klein? Do you know Gucci? But I’d never connected the perfume to my story. \nInstantly, I know what this is about. \nBut I also don’t know.\nMy first thought is: they’re here for me. \nI blurt out: \n\"But you’re not Italian!\"\nI feel so stupid.\n\"Neither are you—\" Tai retorts. \nTai is shaking his head. \"Such old-fashioned thinking,\" he says. \"‘You can't be a Capulet unless you’re Italian.’ I expected more from you, Juliet.\"\n\"And I am Italian,\" the platinum one replies. Yes, her voice does sound Italian.\nI’m disoriented.\n\"If you must know,\" Tai says leisurely. \"My uncle, the chairman of Zhu perfumes, purchased the House of Capulet several years ago.\"\nZhu? \nBut that’s my name. \nI stare at the two of them, perched at the edge of my seat. Like a trapped animal.\n\"So it’s still a family business,\" Tai looks at me.\nWhy did he say it like that?\nI’m observing the warm-eyed woman with platinum hair. She smells sweetly of lilac. \"This is Lucrezia,\" Tai introduces her, \"my assistant.\"\nThere’s an angelic glow to her features. And a sadness hidden below her surface. She feels like beautifully contained sorrow.\nThis meeting is altogether creepy. But what’s strangest is how familiar these two feel. Lucrezia gazes at me in a weirdly caring way.\nTai sits beside me.\n\"I know what’s happened,\" he says.\n\"What’s that?\" I feign ignorance. \nTai just stares at me. It’s a deep, penetrating stare that goes straight through me. It’s otherworldly. As if he can see my thoughts.\nI barely inhale, but I catch his scent for the first time, a smell of hot, burning metal. \nAgain, strangely familiar. \n\"Can I tell you a story?\" he says. \n\"How do you know me?\" I demand.\n\"Patience, Juliet,\" Tai says, casually. \n\"I’m Zu,\" I say defiantly.\nTai smiles, charmingly.\n\"But also Juliet,\" he emphasizes each word. I can’t say he’s wrong, which I like even less. \"How much do you know,\" Tai asks me, \"about the Capulets?\"\nI don’t respond, so he continues. \n\"Shakespeare didn’t say much about us,\" Tai says reflectively. \"He never mentioned our craft. We were a simple family business—with a tradition of being the best perfumers in Europe. No one knows exactly when the first Capulet perfumes were made, but the knowledge was passed down the generations, from father to son—and from father to daughter,\" Tai directs his gaze toward me. \"Back then, it wasn’t all about profits. It was pride in making something perfect.\"\n\"Back when?\" I say, downplaying my curiosity.\n\"This story begins about five hundred years ago,\" says Tai. \"Just before you were born.\"\nHe smiles slyly.\n\"In Verona,\" he says.\nI sink into the red theater seat, as if I can escape what Tai is saying. \nHow does he know this?\n\"The secret of the Capulets,\" Tai continues, \"is that we understand the world of fragrance. Better than anyone.\" \nI want to run away. None of this makes sense, but I know I have to stay. \"Do you know what this means, Juliet?\" Tai quizzes me. \n\"Don’t call me that.\"\n\"What is unlocked by the sense of smell?\" Tai keeps asking questions.\nAs if he expects me to know.\n\"I don’t know—\" I hesitate.\n\"Think, Juliet!\" Tai’s voice explodes. I feel stunned. But I still don’t know.\n\"Memory,\" says Tai.\nHe says the word like a magic spell.\n\"When you catch a fragrance in the air,\" Tai explains, \"what does it trigger? A memory of the past! We can’t always place it, but we feel we’re actually there. That the past is happening all over again! Smell is the most subtle of our senses. It’s the most unconscious, and therefore the most powerful. It holds our deepest, most forgotten memories.\"\nI know this from my own experience. \nI remember nights strolling down a summer lane, smelling lily, instantly remembering my parents’ house when I was five. I can’t say I like Tai and Lucrezia. \nI’m repelled by both of them. \nBut I'm fascinated at the same time.\n\"People came to us, from around the world,\" Tai says, matter-of-factly, \"because we made perfumes that helped them remember! Noblemen, priests, queens—even popes! Everyone wanted to recall their most cherished, forgotten memories. Childhood memories were the most popular—those innocent years when life is so pure. You wouldn't believe how grown men and women longed for their childhood. Powerful men and women—who had everything in the world—their greatest desire was to remember their childhood. That’s the power of innocence.\"\nTai is grinning, looking at me.\nI stare ahead. \n\"Do you know the second most requested memory?\" he asks, still grinning. \"Guess.\"\nI’m startled. \nI’m so engrossed in the story, I don’t expect another question. And why is Tai asking me?\n\"Love,\" I say, automatically.\n\"Exactly!\" Tai exclaims. \nHis excitement surprises me.\n\"That’s very good,\" he smiles. \"First loves, past loves—any loves! We all want to relive the love of our lives—our memories of a person we’ve long forgotten. Usually, it’s our first love. Someone who opened us to our innermost feelings, someone who touched us more than anyone else. You see, Zu,\" Tai pauses, using my name, \"this is the real secret: most of all, we want to remember ourselves! How we felt, how we were—when we were most ourselves. But we don’t realize this. So we try to remember when we were the most touched, the most present, the most alive in our lives. When we remember these times, we begin to remember ourselves.\"\nI am fascinated. It is exactly true.\n\"We started making perfumes by request,\" says Tai. \"Soon it wasn’t just love and childhood. It was everything. Travel memories, military expeditions, family outings, evidence in court cases. Even lost keys! You wouldn’t believe what people wanted to remember! Another favorite was children, especially if they had died. A mother’s most cherished memories of her young children. Never underestimate a mother’s longing for her children, or her loss, when they grow up.\"\nI no longer feel threatened. \nOr want to escape. Not with what’s happening here. In some way, I belong here.\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" I ask directly. \n\"Because, Zu,\" Lucrezia smiles at me, \"you are part of the story.\" I close my ears to this. I don’t trust her, even if what she says rings true.\n\"Our customers began coming to us, with an even bigger challenge,\" Tai continues. \"Do you know what they wanted to remember?\"\n\"Their past lives,\" I answer.\nI am absolutely certain. I don’t know how I know. But the Juliet part of me knows. \nSomehow she knows.\nTai claps his hands, his eyes almost bright.\n\"Bravo!\" he exclaims. \"We weren’t sure this was possible. We didn’t even know if people had past lives! All we knew was that some fragrances could trigger memories in people—of which they had no recollection. Do you understand, Zu? They had a memory—but it had never happened to them. At least not in their current life!\"\nOf course I understand. \nI am unnerved how well I understand.\n\"We took it as a challenge,\" Tai says. \"We set out to create our greatest fragrance: a past-life memory perfume. But no matter how many fragrances we tried, we failed! We were about to give up hope.\"\n\"And?\" I say, surprising myself. \nTai and Lucrezia both smile. Something in their smiles disarms me.\n\"And then you were born,\" Tai says, simply. \nI sit there, trying not to react. Trying not to give my emotions away. I don’t know if he’s telling the truth, but everything in me feels defensive. \n\"To make this perfume, we needed someone with an amazing nose,\" Tai tells me. \"But also someone with imagination—a dreamer—who could understand the deepest secrets of memory. In the Middle Ages, this type of person was called melancholic. The melancholic person was always day-dreaming, going back into their memories, obsessing, re-living them over and over. They would listen to music, or gaze at the stars or across a meadow, and fall into their memories and imagination.\"\nAgain I recognize this in myself. \nIt’s in the way I draw—going so deeply inside myself. I want Tai to be wrong about me. To prove he’s crazy. \nBut he keeps being right. \n\"Nowadays we think everyone is equal,\" Lucrezia adds. \"But it’s not true! If you aren’t melancholic, you have no idea how well you can remember. Melancholics are the masters of memory.\"\n\"So when you were born, Juliet,\" Tai says proudly, \"we knew we’d found who we needed. Who else was such a dreamer as you? From an early age, you could smell a rose across the courtyard. We began training you in the art of fragrance. You were the future of the Capulets.\"\nI’m shell-shocked and can’t speak.\n\"Needless to say,\" Tai makes a sour face, \"we were all very disappointed when you fell for Romeo, obsessed over him—and killed yourself within a week!\" \nTai looks almost angry. \nBut I am furious. \n\"It was out of love!\" I sit forward. \"What do you know anyway? We brought the families together—the Capulets and Montagues. Our deaths ended the feuding!\" \nI stop abruptly. \nI realize I’m speaking about my past memories with a possibly crazed stranger. I feel exposed, vulnerable, and somewhat silly. \nTai looks at me smugly. \n\"That was just a business dispute,\" he says. \"It would have blown over. You and Romeo killed yourselves for nothing.\" Again I feel powerless. I don’t know if he’s telling the truth. \nI’ve lost my mooring in reality.\n\"We need you, Zu,\" Tai steps forward. \"We’ve come to stop you from making the same mistake.\"\n\"Mistake?\" I say.\n\"Romeo,\" Tai answers.\nMy anger boils over. \"Romeo was not a mistake! How did you find me anyway?\" \n\"How did we find you?\" Tai is laughing. \"The same way you found Romeo—we’re connected to you. That’s the first rule of reincarnation! You find people you knew in the past.\" Tai could probably tell me whatever he wanted right now, and I’d believe him. Or maybe not. \"So you’re reincarnated too?\" I challenge him.\n\"Zu,\" Tai sighs. \"Everyone is reincarnated.\" \nI stare down at the red carpet. What Tai is saying is exactly what I was thinking on the subway. But hearing it from him feels horrible. I feel I’ve stepped into a much bigger world, where I hardly know anything. \n\"I’m not leaving Orion,\" I say.\nIt’s the only thing I know. I cling to it.\n\"Ah, that’s his name,\" Tai says.\nI guess one thing they don’t know is names. Until I told them. \"Well, then you’ll be responsible,\" says Tai casually, \"when he dies. Just like last time.\"\n\"What?\" I nearly leap up.\n\"Wake up, Zu—\" Tai nearly spits. \"If you want to save Orion, then let him go.\" \nSave Orion? \nWhat is Tai talking about?\n\"I don’t believe you,\" I say.\n\"Show her,\" Tai turns to Lucrezia.\nLucrezia reaches calmly into her pocket. She sits beside me and opens her palm. I see a smooth piece of metal, shaped into a curve, like a shell. In her other hand, she holds a small, glass vial. \nInside is a deep, blue liquid.\n\"This is Orpheus,\" Lucrezia holds the vial between her fingers. \"It’s experimental.\"\nShe releases one blue drop from the vial. I watch it falling, then colliding into the curved dish. \nIt’s a small bubble.\nThe color of deep, blue sapphire.\n\"Everything has a smell, Zu,\" Lucrezia reminds me. \"Wood, concrete, metal, even glass. But most people can’t smell them. Orpheus also has a smell.\" Lucrezia extends her palm toward me, holding the curved shell and blue drop of liquid. \"If your sense of smell is as keen as I’ve heard,\" she says, pleasantly, \"then you should be able to smell Orpheus, right about—now.\"\nAnd I do.\nIt’s like nothing I’ve ever smelled. How can I describe it? It smells clean—but not like a cleaning product. It’s like a clean wind, like a fragrance that is on the way. It’s the opposite of memory. \nIt’s the future.\nNow I’m seeing images in my mind. Like memories—except it's nothing that’s happened yet. \nIt’s what will happen.\n\"We’ve waited too long, Zu,\" I hear Tai, distantly, \"for you to repeat the same mistake.\"\nI barely pay attention to him. \nThe images I’m seeing are too extraordinary. Everything is swirling, darkness and dense black clouds. It’s a storm, I realize—a tremendous black storm covering the entire skyline over New York City. It’s the middle of the day, but the sun is completely blacked out. The wind whips wildly and rain is coming down in torrents. People in the streets are running for cover, umbrellas blow open. Newspapers and shopping bags, anything not nailed down, are flying through the air.\nI see a large brick building—a building I've never seen. It has large, classical windows and arches. The storm is raging above the building.\nWhat I’m seeing feels like a memory. But it’s nothing I’ve experienced. The emotion I feel is dread. Now I’m seeing inside another building. I see a stage or platform and a crowd of people. There’s chaos and people are scattering. Now the crowd is standing in a circle. Someone is inside the circle, lying on the floor. \nDead.\nOh my God, it’s Orion.\nNo.\nNooooooo. No!\nNot again.\nThis vision is absolutely real. Not for a second do I question it. I can’t. The vision is real. I feel something inside me dying. All the heartbreak and infinite sadness I felt in Verona. Times twice.\nI can’t handle this. \nI snap out of the vision. \nTai and Lucrezia are looking at me. Now I hate them—I want them to die—to disappear. They don’t deserve to be here. It’s like having people you hate at the funeral of your beloved. They don’t deserve to see me grieve.\nI’m too shattered to cry.\n\"The future can still be changed,\" Lucrezia says, gently. \"But it's up to you.\" \nI glare at her, hatefully.\n\"We need you more than Orion,\" Tai looks at me. \"And we have a motto at the House of Capulet,\" he adds. \"Una volta Capuleto, sempre Capuleto. Once a Capulet, always a Capulet.\"\n\"He’ll never leave me,\" I say, pushing down my fear. I wish I’d never left Orion’s studio. \n\"So give him this,\" Tai nods.\nHe holds another glass vial in his hand. This one contains a green liquid, instead of blue.\n\"One breath,\" he says, \"and Orion will forget all about Verona and your past.\"\n\"What is that?\" I say with revulsion.\n\"It’s called Nepenthe,\" Tai says. \"It helps people forget things that are painful, like past lives.\" He presses the green vial into my palm. \n\"I don’t want your—\"\n\"Just one breath,\" Tai interrupts.\nHe closes my palm. I look down, seeing Ori’s red yarn around my wrist. \n\"You have to act quickly,\" adds Lucrezia. \"Every hour, the future becomes more fixed. By tomorrow, it will be too late to save Orion.\"\nMy new life has become a nightmare. \nThis morning all I wanted was to connect with Orion. To continue where we left off. So why is this happening? I used to have a recurring dream that I’d missed all my classes for the year, and now I had to take the final exam. \nI feel hopeless like this. \nOnly much, much worse. \nI’m scared.\n\"Get away from me—\" I push past them. I run up the aisle, bolting out the doors of the theater."

As if I can leave it behind. I step into the street as a horn blares. \nA car screeches to a stop.\nRight in front of me.\nOh—not again!\nI’m staring hard at the vehicle, frightened and half-furious. The gentle-looking woman behind the wheel looks equally terrified. We share a moment of eye contact. It’s the shared anxiety and relief of a near miss. \nI feel my legs trembling. \nBut I need to keep moving. I make my way, crossing into Washington Square Park. I don’t dare look back. I’m half-expecting Tai to rush up behind me. To grab my hair.\nTo force me into his car.\nI keep walking, eyes straight ahead. \nI proceed on the park paths, as steadily as I can, as if any movement might attract attention. \nThe tall green oaks shelter my path. Ahead a double row of benches lines a walkway toward a tall fountain. I slow my steps, looking down at the green vial in my hand.\nI’d forgotten I was carrying it. \nI feel disgusted.\nThe glass vial feels dirty in my hands. I raise it toward my eye, to examine it closer, but my nervous fingers fumble their hold. \nThe glass vial slips from my grasp.\nI try to grab it.\nBut it falls through my fingers. I watch it dropping to the pavement, where it clinks once, bouncing in the air, and then two more times.\nMy heart has stopped.\nI bend down, reaching toward the pavement. Carefully I pick up the vial, inspecting the glass. \nIt appears undamaged. \nI feel a conflicted sense of relief.\nI slip the green vial into my pocket. I want to turn back the clock—to the safety of my world before Jack’s Coffee. But then I wouldn’t have met Orion. \nI can’t go back. \nI’m here, in New York. \nOri and I are here. \nI advance further into the park. People are sitting on benches and walking on the winding paths. Their lives seem so normal, so uncomplicated. \nSo safe.\nI glance around, cautiously. How did that blue perfume make me see the future? \nOr did it?\nAnd Orion’s death? Was that real or did I imagine it? Everything about it felt so real. I’m overcome with revulsion, for everything Tai said to me. \nWho is he to threaten Orion? \nI take the green vial from my pocket, flinging it sideways into the grass. \nI don’t bother watching where it lands. \nImmediately I feel better. I head toward the heart of Washington Square Park, stopping before the splashing fountain. It’s a taller fountain, with a larger pool, than the one I remember from Verona. But it warms my heart nonetheless. I stand along its periphery, listening to the splashing sound of the water. Now I feel how corrupt that green vial was. \nWhat did Tai call it? \nI can’t even remember the name. \nWhatever it was, it was evil. Who would make something that makes people forget? I can’t imagine anything so vile. \nI need to see Orion, I think.\nI head toward an archway in the park, toward Orion’s studio. But approaching the arch, the vision returns to me: the black storm and Orion lying dead. I stop directly under the archway.\nWhat if the vision is true?\nIt strikes me how much Tai knew. About my sense of smell, my past as a Capulet.\nI can’t ignore that. \nHave I just tossed Orion’s life away? \nI turn around, gradually. Nearly against my will, I backtrack to where I tossed away the green vial. Zu, I hear my voice, this isn’t a good idea. \nBut I can’t risk Orion dying. \nNot again.\nBut where did I throw the vial? Before I know it, I’m down on my hands and knees, scavenging in the grass beside the squirrels for that evil green bottle. Except it doesn’t feel so evil anymore. Now it’s something I desperately need. I sit up on my knees, looking around wildly. \nWhere is it?\nThen I see it.\nIn the near distance.\nBetween blades of grass. \nThe clear tip of the vial is just barely visible, near the base of an oak tree. I snatch it up, sliding it safely back in my jeans pocket. \nSomehow I feel stronger already. \nI don’t know what I’m doing.\nBut I can’t lose Orion again. So I am giving myself time. To make the right decision.\nBut didn’t you already decide? I hear my voice again. When you threw it away? I try to tune myself out. I wonder if I've just made a deal with the devil.\nI exhale deeply—and call Orion.\nI hear it ringing.\nWhat am I going to say? I think.\nOrion answers.\nImmediately, I hang up.\nThink this through. Be careful.\nI stare at my phone.\nI make another call.\n\"I need to talk to you—\" I say."

We are revolving around and around each other, in the warm morning. On the railing of the fire escape, a brown starling chirps brightly.\nI touch something on Zu’s arm.\nIt’s a cloth bandage, the kind they give you at the hospital. \"What happened to you?\" I say.\n\"I was hit by a car.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"It was after kissing you,\" Zu embraces me warmly, \"the first time.\" I have too many questions—so I don’t ask any of them. \"It’s why I’m here,\" she smiles.\nZu’s phone goes off.\n\"Oh, it’s Kimmo—\"\nShe pulls away, scanning the screen, then scampers across the room, collecting her backpack from the sofa. Her tablet tumbles out the unzipped opening, sliding toward me across the floor.\nOn the screen is a drawing. \nIt’s a sketch of a hard-featured boy, with a thin, angry mouth.\n\"Who’s this?\" I ask.\nZu draws near me, gazing at the screen. \"I’m not sure,\" she says, pensively. \"I see him in my imagination.\"\nShe looks at me, tenderly. \n\"I’m late for rehearsal,\" she tells me. \nZu wriggles the red yarn bracelet from my wrist. \"I’m taking a souvenir,\" she says, smiling. She slides the red bracelet over her wrist.\n\"So I don’t forget you,\" she teases.\nZu hugs and kisses me, then hurries out the door. From my open window, I watch her go."

I’m still the same boy with a love for starry nights and sunshine, hot cocoa and anime. And I still hate oysters. \nHermes is still my best friend. \nBut now there’s more to the story. \nIt’s like I have more history. I literally have more memories than I did yesterday. There’s actually more of me. Now I’m questioning all my assumptions about myself. There’s so much more data.\nThe water is running over my face.\nEven questions as simple as: \nWhy did I go to Trinity Rose?\nYesterday, that was easy. My parents found the most creative school in the city. I took a tour, I met Hermes and connected with Lauren immediately. It all made sense.\nBut what if it was even simpler?\nI do some morning exercises, hanging upside down in my gravity boots. My eyes are closed. Of course. Why hadn’t I thought of this? \nIt makes perfect sense. \nI went there to meet Zu.\nIt’s so obvious. Of course, I went to Trinity for other reasons too. But this is the real one.\nI mean, it’s Juliet.\nMy life history is being edited on the fly. I didn’t just leave L.A. for New York City. Now I'm seeing the bigger picture. I was living in Verona five hundred years ago, I fell in love and killed myself, and was born again in the desert outside of L.A. \nAnd then I came here. \nTo meet Zu. \nIs this how destiny works?\nI am blending fruits in a blender. I watch my mom on a video from Italy, telling me about her vacation and asking how school is going. But my mind is a million miles away.\nI approach the white dress, my smoothie in hand.\nI barely resist shouting to the sky. \nOut of sheer joy. Then I think: But why? Why did we meet? What is this about? Was it to love each other again? To make up for what we lost? \nDo I even care?\nYes, I do.\nBecause I feel there’s a reason. \nI stand before the white dress. Now it’s obvious what I never liked about it: \nIt was the past. The white dress was about the past.\nI could never be happy with it, because it only lived in the past! How could I be happy with the past? \nWith only sad memories.\nWhen there is a future.\nI am shaken to the core. This problem of the white dress, and all the disappointment of last year: it’s gone in an instant. \nNow I can accept the dress.\nFor what it was.\nI crouch down, touching the soft folds of the white dress. In my memory, I am in the cold Capulet tomb, holding the fabric of Juliet’s white dress. I hold her pale hand. \nI touch her pale, peaceful face. \nBut the memory is changing.\nThe feeling of complete terror—of entering the tomb and finding Juliet dead—is gradually fading. There’s no more ache in my stomach. \nThe pain is gone.\nIn the tomb, Juliet opens her eyes. There’s no need for pain anymore. \nWe are together again.\nI close my eyes, beside the dress.\nImagine the biggest burden you carry. What if that weight was lifted away? Imagine if someone you loved—your mother or your father or your best friend—had died. Then you realize they are actually alive. \nAnd you are with them. \nAgain.\nAcross the studio, my phone goes off.\nI walk over to my work desk.\nIt’s Zu.\n\"Hey—\" I answer.\nZu looks flustered.\nThen the call goes dead.\nI call back, but Zu doesn’t answer. I look out the open window, where I watched her walking away. I return to the kitchen, refilling my smoothie.\nWhen I come back, there’s a message:\nMeet me in Central Park \n20 minutes"

          "text": "Professor Lauren is waiting for me. \nShe stands under a group of trees, wearing a pink cowboy hat with Lorenzo on a leather leash. It’s a gorgeous day in Central Park and the fluffy trees are bright in the breeze.\nI’ve already told her everything. \nWell, except about the green vial and the vision of Ori’s death. I keep those to myself. \n\"So they’re Capulets?\" she asks again.\n\"Not by birth,\" I say.\nI start to remove the green vial from my pocket—to prove I’m not crazy—when I see Orion approaching along a gravel path. \nI hurry to meet him. \n\"What’s going on?\" he says.\nI’ve been thinking what to say. On the one hand, I want to tell Orion everything. But I also want to be careful. Ori spots Lauren behind me. He stops in his tracks, lowering his gaze. \n\"You brought Lauren?\"\nHe sounds immediately defensive.\n\"I didn’t think—\"\n\"But why?\"\n\"Is that so bad?\" I ask. \nOrion doesn’t answer, but closes his eyes. Like he’s in actual pain. I don’t understand this thing between Ori and Lauren.\n\"What is it?\" I say.\n\"It’s nothing,\" he says, unconvincingly.\nAll I want to be doing is hugging him, but right now, we’re not even holding hands. We walk toward Lauren, together but separately. Like two old friends. \nIt’s a little awkward.\nI feel I know everything about Orion. But I’ve also lived my whole life without him. We don’t have any of those endearing habits that most couples have, like a knowing glance or a special way of touching. We haven’t had enough time together.\nNot in this life.\n\"Hello, Orion,\" Lauren says cordially.\nOri nods coolly: \"Lauren.\"\nOh my goodness. You know that saying about cutting tension with a knife?\n\"How are you?\" she asks him.\nOri laughs, but not nicely. \nI haven’t seen this side of him. \"Fabulous,\" he says, \"without any help from you.\"\nLauren seems to stiffen.\n\"You were miserable last year,\" she says.\n\"So send me away?\" \n\"It was just an idea, Ori.\"\n\"And what would’ve happened?\" Ori argues. \"Zu would be at Trinity now. And I’d be at another school.\"\n\"You met anyway!\" says Lauren.\nIt’s like a powder keg between them. And I don’t even know what they’re arguing about! I had assumed the three of us would get along. I want to give them space to work things out. \nBut I don’t have all day, either. \n\"Ori, we need Lauren’s help,\" I interject. I take a quick breath. \"I met Tai and Lucrezia, they’re Capulets. They claim the past repeats,\" I pause again, \"and leaving you is the only way to save your life.\" \n\"What?\" says Ori.\nMy words sound crazy.\n\"They knew everything,\" I try to explain. \"They knew about our past, about Verona! They showed me a vision where you were dead.\"\nI notice Lauren looks pale. \n\"They said it was the future, unless—\" I’m about to blurt out about the green vial in my pocket. But I quickly stop. Ori and Lauren both stare at me.\n\"Unless what?\"\n\"Unless I forget about you,\" I finish my sentence, without mentioning the green vial.\nWhy am I keeping it a secret?\n\"This was this morning?\" Ori looks utterly confused.\n\"I know it sounds crazy,\" I continue. \"But so was yesterday and last night! And they both felt so familiar. Tai said it’s a rule of reincarnation to find people you were connected with in your past. Is that true, Lauren?\"\n\"So now Lauren knows everything?\" says Ori.\n\"Shush,\" I say, lovingly.\nThat felt oddly satisfying.\nLauren walks pensively, a bit ahead of us. Like she’s deep in thought. \nOr in shock. \nI’m not sure which.\nOri and I follow behind her, the green trees forming a canopy above us. At times, our arms bump against each other, which is nice.\n\"I don’t have any personal experience,\" Lauren turns to us. \"But according to tradition—there are laws of reincarnation. And yes, one of them is connection. The idea is we find people we've connected with—people we’ve had special experiences with in the past,\" she looks from me to Ori. \"Often these people feel oddly familiar.\"\nWhat Lauren is saying strikes me. \nI’ve never considered the people in my life this way. Usually, it’s just about whether I like them or not. Or maybe whether I admire them. \nNot whether they feel familiar. \nI quickly dive into my thoughts: Who in my life feels familiar? Do my parents feel familiar? I’ve known them all my life, so of course, they’re familiar. \nBut what if I’d just met them? \nWould they feel familiar then? The way I just knew Ori immediately?\nThat’s a tough one. \n\"Are there other laws?\" I hear Ori ask.\nI am glad he’s engaging Lauren.\n\"Another law is repetition,\" says Lauren. \"The same challenges, or situations, tend to re-occur from life to life. That’s how we learn from mistakes. By facing them again and again, until we overcome them.\"\nI don’t like hearing this.\nIt’s too close to what Tai was saying. About making a mistake with Romeo. What was my mistake anyway? Choosing Ori? When he was Romeo?\nI don’t, I can’t—agree with that. \n\"Do the same things have to repeat?\" I ask Lauren. I edge toward Orion, looking in his eyes, as if I might not always have that luxury. \"Not necessarily,\" says Lauren. \"It’s more about facing a similar challenge. The outcome is up to us.\"\nI’m reassured, somewhat.\n\"Is that like karma?\" asks Ori.\n\"Exactly,\" Lauren says. \"Reincarnation and karma go together. Karma is about balance—the third law of reincarnation. We aren’t reborn just to go around in circles. The purpose of reincarnation is to balance out the imperfections of our past lives.\"\nI wonder what Ori’s imperfections are. So far, I haven’t seen many. But I mean, no one’s perfect. \nRight?\nLauren continues.\n\"Say you mistreated someone in the past,\" she says. \"You might want to help them in your next life. Or maybe you acted shamefully. You might try to atone for it. According to the ancients, the balancing of karma affects almost every part of life—from the people we meet, to where we decide to move and live, our health, and even the way our bodies look.\"\n\"The interesting part, for me,\" says Lauren, \"is about relationships. Say you knew someone in a past life. Maybe you worked together or were in a relationship. But whatever it was, it was left unfinished. You might want to find each other again.\"\nI watch Ori listening to her.\n\"To finish what you started,\" he says, gazing at me with an intensity that stops my heart. I know what we started. But do I really want to finish it? \n\"Finish?\" I say.\nOri chooses another word: \"Continue?\"\nLauren smiles at me, subtly. \"What matters is there’s more to the story,\" she says.\nI’m beginning to feel better. Maybe Tai didn’t know what he was talking about after all.\n\"If you believe in karma,\" Lauren goes on, \"many of the most important people in our lives—a special friend, a romantic partner, maybe even a teacher or a student—are people we knew in a past life. Not everyone, of course. But the ones who feel like we’ve always known them.\"\nLauren stops walking, abruptly.\n\"So you actually remember your past?\" she asks Orion, directly.\n\"Some of it.\"\nThey stand regarding each other.\n\"And it—\" Lauren isn’t sure what to say. \"It matched with what Zu described?\"\nOrion lowers his eyes.\n\"Yeah,\" he says.\nI step forward, gently.\n\"The Capulets say I need to help them,\" I put it all on the table. \"To finish what I started with them.\" I feel Ori bristle at the mention of the Capulets. \"Tai said I was supposed to help with a past-life perfume, when I was a Capulet in Verona.\"\n\"How does Tai know this?\" Lauren asks.\nWe stop in front of a park bench.\n\"He didn’t say. Only that unless I returned to the Capulets, Orion would—die.\" I realize I’m still not telling the entire truth. I haven’t said anything about the green vial—of whatever—in my jeans pocket. I’m afraid that if I do, my worst fear will come true.\nAnd I won’t be able to stop it.\nBut I’m also uncomfortable hiding things. I’ve never hidden anything from Orion. \nEver.\nThis is the first time.\n\"And you believe this person?\" Ori asks me.\n\"I saw it,\" I insist. \"They have a perfume—it shows you the future. I saw you lying dead.\"\n\"It could be a drug,\" he argues, \"a hallucination.\"\nIt’s not impossible. \nAnd yet.\n\"Ori,\" I say. \"It was as real as the past.\"\nOrion takes a few steps away from us. Then he slowly turns around. \n\"I’m not going to die,\" he says.\nSeeing him now, in the sunshine under the trees, it’s impossible not to believe him.\nMy vision feels foolish. \nA soccer ball bounces toward us, with a small boy chasing after it. Ori stops the ball with his foot, then playfully taps it back to the boy. Orion returns, rubbing Lorenzo’s neck. \n\"Why don’t people remember their past?\" he questions Lauren. I’m glad he’s asking. \nI’m wondering the same thing.\n\"The past can be painful,\" says Lauren. \"Imagine if you suffered a terrible loss and had to live with that pain, life after life. By forgetting the past, you get a fresh start. The Greeks thought that’s how we go through life—in forgetfulness of every past life we’ve ever had.\"\nI watch the sunbathers in Central Park. \nYesterday I was like them, oblivious to so much of my existence. Just another amnesia patient, comfortably sipping bubble tea.\n\"That reminds me,\" Lauren says, eagerly, \"of a story in the Odyssey.\"\nMy mind is catching up. The Odyssey.\nBy Homer, right. \nWe read that in eighth grade. About Odysseus and his travels home from the Trojan War. I still remember the cyclops. And the sirens.\n\"It’s just a brief scene,\" says Lauren. \"There’s a banquet and everyone is grieving for Odysseus, who they think has died. Helen, the hostess of the banquet, pours a special potion into the wine. The potion is so powerful that whoever drinks it will forget every suffering. Even if their family was killed before their eyes.\"\n\"What happened?\" I don’t remember this part.\n\"The guests immediately forgot their sorrows,\" says Lauren. \"They became cheerful.\" \n\"What was the potion called?\" Ori asks.\n\"Nepenthe,\" she says.\nWhat? I nearly double over. That was the name I couldn’t remember. The name of the perfume.\nIn the green vial. \nI’m trying to balance myself. Was Tai telling the truth? Could he have actually made a perfume like that? \n\"Did you say Nepenthe?\" I have to be sure.\nOri is walking away from us. He crosses the gravel pathway, walking into Sheep Meadow. \n\"You mean that?\" he points.\nI look up, from my bent-over position.\nOrion points to a tall building, rising above Sheep Meadow. On the building is a giant digital display. I stand upright, slowly moving closer. It’s an advertisement for Capulet perfumes. \nI see an elegant perfume bottle, with a green liquid inside, alongside the name: Nepenthe. The display changes to read: Oblivion Is Bliss\nMy mind grinds to a halt. \nTai didn’t say anything about it being for sale. And I have this perfume in my pocket.\nOh my God, what’s in my pocket isn’t just for Orion. It’s for everyone. \"The Capulets want to make everyone forget,\" I say aloud. \nThere’s no way I can help them now. \nEven if I could.\n\"You think it really works?\" Ori looks dubious. \"It’s probably just marketing. Why would they bother? Doesn’t everyone have amnesia anyway?\" \nHow can Orion be so relaxed? Maybe that’s his imperfection, after all.\n\"No—it works,\" I say.\nSomehow I know.\n\"How do you know?\" Ori asks me. \nAgain I feel trapped. I can’t tell Orion about Nepenthe. If this is all real, it might be my only chance of saving his life. But I also don’t want to lie. \nI bite my tongue.\n\"I just have a hunch,\" I say."

It’s the same corridor from her vision on the plane. \nTai massages his right hand. \nHe clenches and unclenches his fist. \"This clenching,\" Lucrezia observes him, \"concerns me. How long has it been happening?\"\n\"Only a couple days,\" Tai shrugs. \nLucrezia looks sideways at Tai. \"Did anything trigger this?\" she asks. \"Sometimes a traumatic past life event re-appears in the body.\"\n\"You’re the expert,\" Tai says brashly.\nLucrezia probes him. \"You only accessed your Verona life, correct?\" \n\"That was enough,\" says Tai dimly.\nThey take a sharp left turn, arriving backstage of a large auditorium. A stage crew is on their computers, making final adjustments to the lighting. One of them approaches Tai, attaching a microphone to his loose, black shirt. Just beyond the stage, guests in fashionable outfits fill the seats of the auditorium.\nOnstage a woman addresses the crowd. \"We have an unexpected surprise,\" she says. \"Tai Fang, creative director of Capulet perfumes, is here to join us.\" \nTai takes a deep, nervous breath.\n\"How do I look?\" he asks Lucrezia.\n\"Like you.\"\nShe adjusts his shirt.\nThe audience leaps to their feet, cheering and clapping loudly, as Tai walks onstage. Tai grins widely, raising his hand high in the air.\nBehind Tai, an enormous projection comes to life. The Capulet dagger, along with images of beautiful people and perfumes, fills the stage. Luxury Italian villas fade and dissolve into one another.\nTai waves to the audience, who respond in cheers. He places his hands together, as in prayer.\n\"My friends,\" Tai’s voice projects through the auditorium. \"Today I ask you one question: Why do we feel pain? Have you thought about this?\" Tai looks from one side of the audience to the other. \"Why do we have suffering?\"\nThe audience looks toward Tai, waiting.\n\"Well, I thought about this,\" Tai says, reflectively. \"And I couldn’t think of one good reason. The truth is,\" he smiles sadly, \"pain is a disease.\"\nTai is strolling across the stage. \nThe audience follows his every step. \"Today is a day I’ve dreamed about,\" he says deeply. \"Today is a day the world has been waiting for,\" Tai pauses for emphasis, \"since the beginning of humanity.\"\nHe raises his left hand to the screen.\n\"Today we free ourselves from suffering.\"\nQuickly changing images begin to appear: people mourning at a funeral, family members consoling each other, a young woman crying alone, two young men arguing and then fighting.\n\"Civilization has come so far,\" Tai announces. \"We are on the verge of ending racism, ending gender inequality, ending disease and poverty. But despite all our progress—we are still suffering!\"\nThe images of despair continue behind Tai.\n\"No one likes pain and sadness,\" he says. \"But we as a species cannot escape it.\" Tai flashes a victorious grin. \"Until today,\" he points his finger.\nThe screen behind Tai goes white. \n\"We deserve to be happy,\" Tai continues. \"We deserve to laugh. At the House of Capulet, we believe this with all our hearts.\"\n\"So we made Nepenthe,\" says Tai.\nCheers explode through the crowd. The auditorium floor is shaking. On the white screen appears a single image: \nNEPENTHE\n†\n\f\"Welcome to a new world,\" Tai is grinning. \"A world without sorrow. A world without suffering.\" The crowd whistles and roars. \nTai smiles, waiting to speak. \n\"Three thousand years ago,\" he grins, \"there was a party—this is a true story, it’s in Homer. But all the guests were plagued with sorrow. The hostess knew, this was no way to party!\"\nTai keeps grinning.\n\"So she put a secret potion into the wine,\" he says, \"which cured everyone’s sorrow.\"\nImages of Helen’s banquet play out on the screen behind Tai. All the guests, in Greek attire, are laughing and smiling at once.\n\"Our chemists and perfumers—and myself, personally—we labored days and years to reassemble this secret formula, as a perfume,\" says Tai. The crowd can’t stop cheering.\n\"One breath,\" Tai holds up his index finger, \"and goodbye sorrow—hello happiness.\"\nTai waves triumphantly, leaving the stage. As he nears Lucrezia, his eyes are tearing.\n\"That was impressive,\" Lucrezia says.\nTai continues backstage, without stopping. \n\"I just realized,\" he turns toward her, wiping his eyes. \"Juliet only knew Romeo for three days in Verona. If they hadn’t killed themselves,\" he smirks, \"they might have broken up within a week!\"\nLucrezia’s eyes reflect a mix of emotions. \nTai seems absolutely gleeful. \"Maybe their love isn’t as strong as they think.\" \nLucrezia changes the topic. \"How can you talk about Nepenthe like that?\" she asks him. \"When you actually remember your past?\"\nTai replies: \"But I wish I didn’t.\"\nLucrezia observes him.\n\"That’s sad,\" she says."

She motions to Lorenzo, who jumps onto the seat. The cabbie groans loudly, shaking his head.\nLauren has a meeting, so we’ve agreed to meet tonight at her apartment. That feels dangerously far from now, but I don’t know what else to do. Seeing the Nepenthe ad has shaken me.

After all, maybe Ori is right.\nMaybe I am overreacting.\nI decide to forget about the Capulets and Nepenthe—at least for now—and enjoy my time with Ori. \nThese are the first free moments we’ve had. \nI take Ori's arm, pulling myself close. Gradually I feel him beginning to relax. He’s changed from last night’s blue hoodie into a white t-shirt. Nestling closer, I take a deep, though not too obvious, breath. It’s difficult to describe in words how a person smells. But Ori is a mix of pewter and olive, mixed with sandalwood.\nI love this scent. \nTo me, it feels smooth and kind of awakening. To really love someone, you have to love their scent. \nAll my curiosities bubble to the surface. \nWho is this person on my arm? \nIn this life, I mean. What does he like to do? What kind of friends does he have? Does he like scary movies? Sing in the shower? What does he eat for breakfast? \nI want to know—everything.\nCentral Park is active, yet peaceful this afternoon. We leave the paved path, crossing the green grass. I disengage from Ori’s arm, momentarily stepping away.\n\"So—\" I joke. \"How’ve you been?\"\nOri cracks a smile.\n\"What do you want to know?\" he laughs.\n\"Mmmm,\" I say, thinking it over. \nI am enjoying this playful distance. \"How long have you lived in New York?\" I start with basics.\n\"Three years,\" says Ori. I was hoping he’d reveal more, but I don’t want to push him. \"I’ve only been here three weeks,\" I offer up. \n\"Where did you move from?\"\n\"Hong Kong,\" I say. Right now, it feels further away than the moon. I find myself thinking of my mother. I can’t imagine what she would say about this. I ask another easy question. \"Favorite food?\"\n\"Pistachios,\" Orion grins.\n\"Why?\"\n\"They’re soft. But crunchy.\"\nOri raises his eyes. \n\"You?\" he asks curiously.\n\"Umm,\" I reply. \"Lychee?\"\n\"The fruit?\"\n\"Yeah,\" I surprise myself.\nOri is looking at me peculiarly, a mix of absorbed and admiring. Either way, I like it. We do have a natural chemistry. \"My favorite color is green,\" I decide to just open up. \"Maybe because I love the smell of mint,\" I say. \"I also love astronomy, bubble tea, French poetry and—drawing.\" We’re heading for a small cluster of trees in a clearing. \"And I have hyperosmia.\"\n\"You do?\"\nOri looks serious.\n\"That means I smell well,\" I smile.\n\"Oh,\" Ori exhales. \"I thought it was a disease!\"\nWe both break into laughing fits, which feels really, really good. I can feel the ice melting between us. \"I didn’t know what—\" Ori is still laughing. \"I thought maybe—\" he laughs, \"maybe it was something fatal.\"\n\"No,\" I can’t stop smiling. \"No, it’s not at all.\" I try to regain my composure. \"Okay, do you have a question for me?\" \nOri is thinking about it. \n\"Okay, my turn again,\" I say quickly, emboldened. I consider filtering myself, but then I just blurt out: \"Have you had any girlfriends?\"\nI add: \"Or, boyfriends?\"\nWe take several, eternal strides. \nI stifle a nervous grimace. I’m glad I’m no longer attached to Ori’s arm. But I am holding my breath. \n\"No,\" Ori says slowly.\nI’m stunned. So it is true.\nHis answer feels so honest. \nThis is why I asked my question in the first place. Because I want to know who Ori really is. Not just on the surface, but deep inside. \n\"Why not?\" I ask, swallowing.\nOri gazes down at the green grass, walking. I can feel him feeling into my question.\n\"It never seemed right,\" he says simply. \nHis words go through me, like a sugar high. \nOur conversation is opening more in me than I expected. The way we’re talking relieves me. There is a power in our honesty. \nI want to pull Orion close. But I keep my distance for a little longer. We reach the clustered trees and lie in the sunny grass.\nOri is opposite me, his face to mine.\n\"What about you?\" he says, interested.\n\"Oh, me? Not really,\" I say, embarrassed. \"I had a—well, he wasn’t even my boyfriend, really. He was on the soccer team,\" I am babbling. \"It was only a week.\"\n\"What happened?\"\nThe way Ori asks the question, simply and directly. It makes me think about it. In a way I haven’t before.\n\"He didn’t really see me,\" I knit my brow.\nOri nods, like he understands. Our connection is growing deeper, quickly. I feel Ori’s eyes on mine. It’s almost too much. I pick a daisy and roll it between my fingers to distract myself. I can feel Ori observing me. \"So why did you move here?\" he asks me.\n\"My dad got a job here,\" I say, automatically. Then I look up and say, \"But I think there’s another reason.\"\n\"What is it?\" asks Ori.\n\"Isn’t it obvious?\"\nOri doesn’t get it.\n\"I came to meet you,\" I say quietly.\nFor the first time, Ori seems caught off-guard. He glances down into the grass, while I hold the daisy between my fingers. \nOri inches his head forward, slowly, until suddenly we are kissing. Our bodies extend just far enough to meet at our lips.\nI’m surrounded by Ori’s olive and pewter scent. \nIt’s sublime, intoxicating. I taste the soft tips of his lips. All around us, the park is peaceful and calm. I smell the verdant soil and the sharp tang of the grass. There is a whirlwind of city scents from Central Park West, wafting in the air, and the dusty, woody bark and branches of the oak tree above us. \nEverything feels right.\nBeing here with Ori, I feel the shock of the time crossing wearing off. Within me, my experiences are beginning to integrate. \nBoth of my lives—Agnes Zhu and Juliet Capulet—are actually the same person. Well, not exactly the same. It’s totally different being born in a different century, on a different continent. I mean, I no longer understand Italian. And I don’t really like pasta.\nBut the real me isn’t Juliet Capulet. \nOr even Agnes Zhu. \nThe real me is bigger than both of my lives. They’re just different expressions of who I really am.\nThis feels important.\nI’ve lived my whole life as Agnes Zhu. I know this person inside and out. But the real me is more of a mystery. Someone I am just starting to know."

Tai shakes his head firmly. Johan, the perfumer, claps his hands in admiration, smiles and takes off through the crowd.\nFor a moment, Lucrezia and Tai are alone. \nThey stand before a window of the New York skyline, beside a long table covered with a white tablecloth, champagne glasses and rose petals. Guests are chatting among the hors d'oeuvres. One of them is a darkly toned woman, wearing an impeccable white suit.\nTai approaches the long table.\nThe woman in the white suit finishes her conversation, meeting Tai beside the vase of rose petals. She smiles warmly.\n\"Hello Tai,\" she says.\n\"Santiaga,\" Tai greets her, respectfully.\n\"It seems the perfume business is booming,\" Santiaga sips sparkling water from a glass.\nTai allows a shy grin.\n\"Care to try Nepenthe?\" a Capulet employee appears, waving a green strip in Santiaga’s direction. The odorized vapor wafts rapidly into the air, expanding in range, ten million molecules of Nepenthe drifting toward Santiaga. In a half second, the misty green odor encircles Santiaga’s nose, engulfing her sense of smell. \n\"Lovely,\" she says, calmly.\nLucrezia notices Santiaga’s lack of reaction. \"My compliments on the fragrance,\" Santiaga says. \"But I am concerned about the effect.\" \nShe gazes at Tai. \n\"Forgetfulness?\"\nTai drops his social smile. He steps closer to Santiaga, lowering his voice. \n\"It’s what people want,\" he explains. \n\"Is that so?\" says Santiaga.\n\"Life is hard sometimes,\" Tai asserts. \"Why shouldn’t we have an escape? If people want to forget their pain, who are we to stop them?\"\nSantiaga smiles imperceptibly. Her eyes have an otherworldly depth. As if the whole universe lay hidden behind them.\n\"People also want to feel,\" she says, matter-of-factly. \"Pain and sorrow aren’t comfortable, but they help us understand who we are,\" Santiaga looks at Tai. \"Life’s not meant to be numb.\"\nTai’s confident exterior is fading.\n\"You won’t try to stop us, will you?\" he asks. \nSantiaga pours sparkling water into her glass. She appears to be thinking about a thousand things at once, assimilating a thousand insights in the simple act of pouring water. \n\"No, we won’t stop you,\" Santiaga looks from Tai to Lucrezia, like she’s seeing their thoughts. \"But consider this a friendly warning,\" her eyes burn. She takes a last sip of water, stepping past Tai and Lucrezia into the crowd. \nLucrezia turns quickly to Tai.\n\"Why didn’t it affect her?\" Lucrezia asks, puzzled. Tai has a faraway gaze. He stares into the crowd where Santiaga has gone.\n\"She’s a Montague,\" he says."

          "text": "Ori and I leave the daisy patch behind.\nWe climb a winding stairway toward a bluff. Ahead of us is a stone building, like a miniature castle. A sign says it’s named Belvedere Castle and built in 1869. We explore a wooden gazebo, overlooking a pond with small turtles. We sit on a stone wall above the pond.\nI lean against Ori, letting him support me. We are definitely getting comfortable.\n\"Tell me about your drawing,\" he says.\n\"Oh,\" I say. \nExcept for Lauren and Kimmo, no one ever asks me about my drawings. But maybe, it’s also because I never talk about them. \n\"Well—my drawings are stories,\" I say, finding the words. \"They tell a story.\"\nOri is staring out over the pond. \nAs if he’s seeing the future.\n\"What kind of story?\" he asks.\nI smile, self-consciously. \"That’s a good question,\" I pause. \"I kept trying to figure that out,\" I say. \"I kept feeling that my story—the story I had to tell—would come through my drawings.\"\nOri is looking at me. \n\"But it always felt out of reach,\" I continue. \"So I just kept drawing.\"\n\"And what happened?\"\n\"I met you.\"\nOrion turns to me, not understanding. \"The drawing on my tablet,\" I say. \"From the moment I made it, I always felt I knew this person—and it was you. Somehow I drew you. It was buried inside me.\"\nOri is gazing over the pond again. He is contemplating something.\n\"That happened to me too,\" he says.\n\"I know,\" I say. \"The white dress.\" \nI am starting to be able to read his expressions. \"We both like creating,\" Ori observes.\nA spark lights up inside me. I’ve just discovered a link with Ori that’s beyond him just being Romeo. Beyond Verona.\nBeyond our past. \nAn interest we share, here and now.\n\"I want to do things together,\" I say impulsively. \nI feel my inspiration bubbling up.\n\"We only had three days together,\" I say at once. \"In Verona—we didn’t have time to do anything! But now we have time.\"\nA reminder of Nepenthe intrudes on my mind, but I push it away. Across the pond, the tiny turtles peek up from the thin reeds.\nWe scamper down a pathway that descends from Belvedere Castle. I’ve completely forgotten about Lauren and this morning. Now it’s only Orion and I. In the trees above us, I hear birds and distant voices across the park. We descend a long wooden stairway. Ori is just ahead of me. There’s a rhythm in the way we’re walking, as if our bodies are in sync. \n\"What else do you want?\" Orion asks me.\nIt’s another question I’m not used to. But with Ori, I feel I can say anything. \"Let’s see,\" I begin, playfully arching my neck. \"A hundred sunny days in a row, a boba tea machine, a little dog robot, edible pencils,\" I’m feeling pretty good about my list, \"and my driver’s license.\"\n\"You don’t have a license?\"\n\"Nope.\"\nI take another step on the stairs. I have one more thing on my list.\n\"I want to tell a great story,\" I say. \nThere’s a strength in my voice. This is the first time I’ve admitted this, even to myself. Somehow saying this aloud feels powerful. \nAgain I catch that look in Orion, like he’s seeing into the future. \n\"Anything else?\" he asks.\n\"Maybe,\" I say. \nI can’t think of anything. But I want to keep my options open. In the humid green air, I can smell the evening drawing near.\nThis is the happiest I have ever felt.\nBelow the stairway is a tall bronze statue. Ori and I approach it together. \nIt’s a statue of two young people, embraced in a kiss. Inscribed on the concrete block below the figures are the names: Romeo and Juliet.\n\"Look at this!\" I exclaim.\nWe stand there, with strange expressions on our faces. Ori looks somewhere between puzzled, disbelieving and hilariously amused. I start to speak out, but I don’t know what to say. So I just cover my mouth.\nA man in a brown shirt passes by us, looking up at the bronze statue. \"If only love was like that!\" he gestures passionately.\nWe burst out laughing.\n\"It looks nothing like us,\" Ori observes.\nHe takes out his phone. We stand before the statue, wipe the smiles from our faces and look straight ahead, in an ironic, hardcore kind of way.\nOri snaps our selfie."

Behind the doorman appear several ghostly images. Faded and transparent, they are like old photos from the past. The first is an elderly woman, who covers her head in a shawl. Further in the background—as if further back in time—a man with a bald head and determined look stares ahead. Behind this image is a third one, barely visible—a young boy. \nAll this happens in an instant, as Santiaga passes the doorman, stepping into the lobby.\n\"Have a lovely day,\" she says.\nThe doorman, and the faded images, all smile back.\nSantiaga passes through the hotel lobby. A crowd of tourists and business people mingle in groups. Ghostly images arise behind each of them. A tired looking accountant behind a businessman, a lazy gambler behind a tourist, a monk with a shaved head behind the hotel bellman. The entire lobby is filled with the faded images of people’s past lives. \nSantiaga notices them all, without changing her stride. At the rear of the lobby, she enters an open elevator. \nThe doors close behind her. \nSantiaga stands alone in the elevator.\nWhen the doors open, she steps out into an airy suite, decorated in a modern style. The windows are open and curtains blow lightly in a breeze. There is a large desk with papers, several paintings on the elegant walls, dark handcrafted chairs and tall ceilings. \nSantiaga walks directly across the room, unbuttoning her white jacket. She drops it over an armchair and continues toward a set of double doors. She pushes open the double doors in a single, graceful motion. Without pausing, she enters a large room.\nSantiaga smiles softly, her left palm upraised. \"Now is the fun part,\" she says quietly.\nShe takes two or three steps and is engulfed in bluish white light.

          "text": "Dusk falls over New York City.\nThe lampposts of Central Park flicker to life, in white and amber hues. Orion and I walk a winding path in the early blue evening. The silence of the dusk is beating upon the treetops. \nAn ash-like scent of leaves fills the air. \nEvening joggers pass by, as a horse-drawn buggy rattles along in front of us. I hear the clacky-clack of their hooves. All of Central Park is blue and peaceful. Ori and I don’t say anything. We don’t have to. I’m just watching and listening.\nLetting life happen. \nAnything is possible. If I just let it happen. \nWe near a restaurant with outdoor seating, festive lights swaying overhead from wires. I can’t even remember the last meal I ate. \nWas it really soup at Lauren’s place? \nYesterday? \nMy belly is like a hungry monster. I grab Ori, practically dragging him toward the tasty smells. \n\"Wanna have a meal?\" I say.\n\"That’s the Tavern,\" he says, like that’s supposed to mean something. \n\"Aren’t you hungry?\" I ask again. \nI scan the outdoor menu. Quickly I spot burgers, minestrone soup and fish and chips, among many other choices. This place will be perfect. \nThe friendly host seats us outside. \nI’m not sure I’ve ever had a meal with Orion. \nWe can see Sheep Meadow, where Lauren met us earlier, from our table. For a while we just sit relaxing, watching the people in the park. I take a sip of my water. This is the most normal I’ve ever felt with Orion. For once, no one is fighting or crying or running away. I watch Ori, tugging absently at his necklace. \nI look down at the red yarn, on my wrist.\nI’m wondering: what would it be like to just have normal time with Orion? \nWithout any drama. \nJust the two of us, and New York City. \nI’ve never had anyone like that. Someone I could trust and share anything with. I always envied those couples I saw at school, who had someone they could depend on. How would it feel to be so close to someone? So trusting? I guess I know. \nBut that was a long time ago. \nI’m ready for more. \nOri looks at the menu: \"Oh no, oysters.\" \nOur waiter arrives quickly. I order the burger, medium rare, with fries and extra cheese. And the minestrone soup. Ori gets the fish and chips, which also sounds really appetizing to me. \nI feel like making a toast. \nBut to what? I rapidly imagine a few scenarios: \"Here’s to reincarnation!\" Way too weird. \"Here’s to rebirth.\" Too nerdy intellectual. \"Here’s to us!\" Too vain, by far. \"To second chances?\" Too corny. \"Here’s to love.\" That’s not bad, but maybe better left unspoken.\n\"I love you,\" I say. \nI’ve never said anything so real. \nAcross the table, Ori’s eyes fasten to mine. Again it’s the power of honesty. I feel his eyes speaking to me, beyond any words. \nOrion smiles.\nThe festive amber lights twinkle overhead. Our waiter appears with a basket of bread. \n\"I saw your stream,\" I say. \n\"You did?\" says Ori. His eyes flash back, recollecting what I might be talking about. \"Wait—\" he says suddenly. \"Do you mean?\" \n\"Before we met.\"\nI watch his eyes, \"You came to the screen.\"\nOri is remembering, wordlessly. \"I felt that—\" he says. Now I’m speechless, too. \"I went to the screen,\" he says, \"and waited.\"\nHe looks astonished.\n\"I was about to post—\" I add, quickly, \"but I chickened out.\" I don’t know what else to say. We are both feeling an amazement for—what?\nThe world, I guess?\nLife?\nThere is a melody playing in the restaurant. It moves into the silence between us, perfectly. I don’t know what the music is, but it’s perfect. \nFor this moment. \n\"Why did you drop out?\" I ask calmly.\nOri doesn’t seem to react—not outwardly—but I can feel I’ve hit a nerve. \"I didn’t drop out,\" he says, firmly. \"I’m just not in school.\" \nWhat’s the difference, I wonder. \n\"But why?\" I say. \nOri looks challenged. For a moment, I’m not sure he’s going to tell me.\n\"I had a difficult year,\" he says, uncertainly. \"It was unlike me. I’m an outgoing person, usually,\" he looks up at me. \"But I wasn’t feeling like myself. Lauren tried to help, she thought if I transferred—\" he doesn’t finish the sentence. \"I didn’t feel there was anything there for me. Everything I was looking forward to—wasn’t there anymore.\"\nHe looks down at his napkin. \n\"What were you looking forward to?\"\nI wait silently. \n\"I don’t know,\" he answers.\n\"I was supposed to come last year,\" I say immediately. \"But my dad’s job got delayed.\" \n\"Is that true?\" Ori literally demands. \n\"Yes,\" I state. \nOri sits back in his chair, painfully. Like he’s recovering from something. \"All last year,\" he says, \"it was like something was ripped away.\" We sit under the twinkling lights.\nOrion feels raw, exposed. Vulnerable. \nI like it. \nIt lets me feel him, even more. \nOri is letting me inside his world. And maybe, I am doing the same. I say, delicately, \"Maybe you could come back now.\"\nOri looks toward me. \nI am seeing a whole other side of him. I had no idea what he was carrying inside. Something about this almost brings me to tears. \n\"You could enter The Lights,\" I say.\nOri looks at me, openly. \n\"I’m sure they’d make room for you,\" I say, eagerly. \"It’d be a great way to come back. And you’ve already won twice,\" I say, proudly. \nI feel like Ori is actually considering it. \"I have a better idea,\" he says.\n\"What?\"\nI can feel my anticipation. \n\"Why don’t you enter?\" he says.\n\"Me?\" \nI check my fears, and exhilaration. \nSubconsciously, I’m telling myself it’s too much. I don’t deserve it. I haven’t worked hard enough. I’m not good enough. But another part of me is interested. \n\"No,\" I say.\n\"No?\" \n\"No,\" I answer. \"It’s only two days away!\" \n\"It’s spontaneous. That’s the point.\" \n\"It doesn’t matter—\" I protest. \"I don’t have any—\" I stop in mid-sentence. What am I going to say? I don’t have any talents? \nJust like Kimmo said to me. \n\"I don’t know what I’d do,\" I re-phrase myself, as calmly as I can. Ori is observing me across the table. Catching his gaze, I ground myself. \n\"Tell your story,\" he says, simply.\nI feel Ori is saying something to me. Something important. But I backpedal.\n\"What story is that?\" I ask him. \n\"The one you have inside,\" he says.\nI push my foot into the stone patio. I feel cornered by these words.\n\"But that story’s already been told,\" I point out. \"Shakespeare wrote it and everyone knows it!\" \n\"That’s not your story,\" says Ori, patiently. \"That’s a story written about us—by someone else. The story you have to tell is different.\" \nIt’s true, I can feel it.\n\"What Shakespeare wrote was only Act One,\" Ori leans forward on the table. \"And it’s already happened! There’s more to your story.\"\nHe’s right. \nI can feel the power in that. \nBut I still don’t know what it means. I appreciate Ori encouraging me, but I feel like he’s asking too much. I have no idea how to do this. \nI shake my head, smiling. \n\"I’m not ready,\" I say. \n\"No one’s ready,\" Ori says easily. \"If you’re ready, it’s probably too late.\"\nI inhale deeply. \nI’m reminded of what my dad once said. When a chance comes along, we’re never ready. That’s how you know you should do it. \nLike on the High Line, when I kissed Ori. I wasn’t ready for that. \nNow look at us.\n\"I can help you,\" Ori offers. \nSomething in me wants this so much. It feels like the reason Ori and I are here. \nTo do something together. \n\"I know how The Lights works,\" Ori entices me. \"We’ll have Lauren save you a spot.\" \nI’m on the verge of agreeing, crazily. \n\"But what am I gonna do?\" I point out the main obstacle. \"I don’t even know my story!\"\n\"Everyone has a story,\" Ori says, confidently. \"That’s the easy part. You just choose how you want to tell it. In whatever way you want.\"\nI sip my water, seriously, then place my glass back on the table. \"Okay,\" I accept the challenge. \"On one condition.\" \nOrion looks interested. \n\"You go back to Trinity,\" I say. \nHe smiles, leaning back nervously.\nOr hesitantly. \n\"The day after The Lights,\" I add, firmly. \nOrion looks at the table. I am hoping so hard he says yes. His eyes rise, lightly. \n\"Okay,\" he agrees. \"It’s a deal.\" \nI feel a joy escaping in my heart. Although it doesn’t make sense, I feel we’ve agreed to something larger than The Lights and Trinity Rose. \nThis is what I want. \nI smell our food arriving. \nIn a moment, our waiter appears with our plates, placing them in front of us. Ori’s fish and chips looks even tastier than I imagined. \nWe dig in, savoring our meals. Now Ori seems as hungry as I am. We begin chatting easily, between mouthfuls, about all kinds of things. About our lives, our friends, about who we are. It feels so simple, like with a friend you’ve known forever. I tell Ori about Trinity and my classes, and further back—growing up in Hong Kong. The beaches I loved, my friends and doing karaoke, and the humid, green hills.\nI taste Ori’s fries and a bite of his fish. The amber lights are sparkling above our heads. Orion is telling me about the desert and his family, and about his sister, how close they were when he was younger, and how she died in a car accident four years ago. He tells me this calmly, while I listen. Then he moves on, to Hermes, how brilliant and wonderful he is, and about the interesting company that Hermes’ dad started. \nBut I’m still thinking of his sister. \nOri’s phone buzzes, beside his fries.\n\"Hey,\" Ori looks up, his eyes happy. \"Do you want to meet my friends? They’re at Hermes' house.\" \n\"Yeah,\" I say. \nOf course. Everything feels easy now. I’d love to dive deeper into Ori’s world. \n\"Oh, wait—\" I say.\nWe are leaving our table. \"What about Lauren?\" Remembering our meeting with Lauren is like a bucket of icy water. It brings back all the gravity.\nThe Capulets. Ugh.\n\"We’ll just drop by,\" says Ori. \"Then head over to Lauren’s.\" It sounds reasonable. \nOri and I feel so strong now.\nIndestructible. \n\"Okay,\" I smile."

I wrap my arms snuggly around Ori’s waist, a warm breeze over my face. \nWe exit the park and enter Columbus Circle among a herd of yellow cabs. I watch the lighted fountains at play inside the circle, calm amid the swirling traffic. We escape the circle, onto Broadway. Ori accelerates and we pass traffic lights, drug stores and banner displays for movies, plays and shows. I gaze up at the passing advertisements, like stars in the night. All of Broadway jumps with giant displays, some three or four stories tall. \nAhead are bright, white lights. \nThey rise, like beacons, upon the sides of buildings. Ori changes lanes, pulling alongside a shiny tour bus. On either side of us are gift shops, nail salons and delis, Asian restaurants, yellow three-wheeled pedicabs and bicyclists in the green bike lanes. \nThe lights ahead grow brighter. \nIt’s like a temple in the night. I hear Ori saying Times Square. There are people everywhere, crossing a sparkling stone concourse under the towering lights. There are so many displays and flashing ads that I don’t know where to look, or rest my eyes. Mounted police on horseback watch over the crowds. \nOri pulls us over. He removes his helmet, smiles at me and gets off the scooter. I walk with Ori into the heart of Times Square. The lights and buildings only seem to grow, as we pass through the crowd. People move in every direction. I feel the world revolving around Times Square, with us at its center. \nOri gazes up at our surroundings. \nOne of the tall displays catches his attention. He steps toward it, then stops. Ori stands still, his darkened outline before the massive light. \nI walk toward him, standing beside him before the four-story display. We are two dark silhouettes against a blazing glory of light. Stretching out my fingers, I take Ori’s right hand in mine. We stare into the animated faces and tv shows, fashion shoots and digital static, bouquets of green and yellow flowers exploding like fireworks. \nFor the first time in New York, I feel at home. \nThe images are cascading in flashing waves. Waterfalls change to oceans and beaches, then disappear again in gauzy bursts of light. \nSomehow in these lights is my future. \nIs Ori’s future. Is our future. I can’t explain it in words. But in these fireworks of light is everything Ori and I can become. \nWe leave Times Square behind. \nI press myself behind Ori’s back, my arms tightly across his chest. The skyscrapers of New York grow darker, as I lean my helmet against Ori’s, listening to the purr of the scooter and the passing cars. \nWe stop at a traffic light. \nAcross the intersection is another bright, green ad for Nepenthe. It sits atop a square, glass building, with the Capulet dagger adorning the storefront windows. Inside are fancy-dressed guests, while others arrive outside in expensive cars. \nOri turns his helmet sideways, as we pass. The street is lined with lamppost banners for Nepenthe. I look back as we ride on, until the Capulet store is left behind. \nBut I can’t escape it. \nIt stains my memory, like a black cloud. \nWe arrive on a quiet, tree-lined avenue, slowing down outside a large, brick building. Ori parks the scooter and we both get off. I remove my helmet, my hair sweeping out. I reach into my pocket, when something falls out onto the stone sidewalk. \nWith a loud clink. \nOh no.\nI scamper after the green glass vial.\n\"What’s that?\" Ori eyes me. \nMy stomach plunges. \nEverything I’ve been trying to avoid—the Capulets, the vial of Nepenthe and the vision of Ori’s death—comes crashing back at once. \n\"Oh nothing,\" I scoop it up. \"It’s just a sample.\" \nI’m not sure what’s worse. The idea of Ori dying, or the way I feel about what I’ve just said. \nAnother lie.\nIt feels like a cancer growing. \nBut I can’t tell Orion about Nepenthe. Can I? I could, but I’m too afraid.\nSo I don’t. "

          "text": "I smile tightly and take Ori’s hand. \nHe seems to believe me. We cross the street toward the large, brick building. It’s actually more of a mansion. Coming closer, the trees begin to recede, and I can see the building unobscured.\nMy steps slow to a stop.\nI can’t believe what I’m seeing.\nThe brick mansion is the same building I saw in the vision at the theater. From Lucrezia’s blue perfume. I can’t deny it. \nOr question it.\nIt’s the exact same building. \n\"Zu—?\"\nI hear Ori’s voice.\nI force myself to speak.\n\"I've seen this building before,\" I say bluntly.\n\"Well, it’s kind of historical,\" Ori explains. \"It’s been photographed a lot. Hermes’ dad bought it a few years ago.\"\nI am listening.\nBut I didn’t see this place in a photograph.\nThis changes everything! It brings the reality of my vision to a whole new level. Before now, it was just an extremely real experience. \nNow I have confirmation.\nDoes this mean everything I saw: the massive black storm, and most of all, Ori’s death, is real? \nBut in my vision, the black storm was over the building. Now the sky is perfectly clear, not even a breeze. Does that mean the future is wrong?\nOr it hasn’t happened yet?\nOrion and I continue toward the mansion.\nWe pass some kids near the gated entrance. I think maybe I recognize one of them, from Trinity Rose. I notice the watchful way they look at Orion.\n\"Hey guys,\" Ori says hello.\n\"Oh, hey Ori—\" they say, in unison.\nWe ascend the wide steps to the entrance. Without bothering to knock, Ori opens the large front door and we step into a huge entryway. We’re immediately greeted by a young butler in a black tuxedo. \nHe has two glasses on a tray.\n\"Care for a refreshment?\" he asks.\n\"No thanks,\" says Ori.\n\"I’ll take one.\"\nThe butler lifts one of the glasses with his elegantly gloved hand, but catches the bottom against the lip of the tray. The liquid splashes over me, while the glass shatters on the floor. \n\"Whoops,\" the butler hides a smile. \nRecovering my shock, I realize I’m not wet.\n\"Another of Hermes’ tricks,\" Ori looks bemused. He extends his hand through the body of the butler, waving it back and forth. \"It’s a hologram,\" he says.\n\"Ex-cuse me,\" says the butler.\n\"Look at you two—\" \nI see Hermes, the boy from last night. He sounds happy to see us. \"I’m so glad you made it,\" he ushers us in. \"Come on, we’re out by the pool.\"\nWe follow Hermes inside.\n\"Great to see you,\" Hermes looks at me. \"I wasn’t sure what happened. After you showed up last night. And I don’t see Ori in school anymore,\" he winks at me, \"since he started his sabbatical.\"\n\"Ori’s returning to school,\" I tell him.\n\"Oh, really?\"\nHermes glances at Ori.\n\"It’s conditional,\" explains Ori.\n\"Ori needs a good influence,\" Hermes smiles at me. \"He’s lucky he found you.\"\nWe pass through a series of large rooms. At the doorway to one of them, I notice the most delicate blue butterflies floating in the air. I hover in the doorway, admiring them.\nI’m still processing being here, inside the house from my vision. And what this means. Standing near the blue butterflies soothes me.\nEven if it’s only a hologram. \n\"Why is this house historical?\" I ask curiously. I wonder if there’s a reason I saw it. We are leaving the blue butterflies behind. \n\"It’s one of the oldest in the city,\" Hermes replies. But I feel there’s more he’s not telling me.\nI don’t know why.\nI follow Hermes and Ori outside to a stone patio overlooking the house grounds. I didn’t know anyone in New York had so much space. We descend the patio stairs to a large swimming pool. \nI see a group of kids around the pool.\n\"Look who I found,\" says Hermes.\n The girl nearest me says: \"Hi, I’m Wen.\" \nShe has short, dark hair, cut sharply at her cheekbone, and sparky eyes. From the friendly way she greets me, I feel we could be friends. \nA boy with a thick, blond mohawk stands up behind Wen. \"Angelo,\" he extends his hand.\n\"Zu—\" I shake it.\nThere’s something unusual about Hermes’ friends. For one thing, they all look so unique. Back home, everyone kind of dressed the same. We even wore uniforms to school. If anything, I was the unusual one.\nBut it’s also something else.\n\"You got Ori out of hiding,\" Angelo says. \n\"Did I?\" I say.\n\"We’re all in debt to you, Zu,\" Angelo laughs, whimsically.\nThey seem to know Ori pretty well.\n\"Hi Zu,\" a boy in a Trinity \"Rose\" hoodie waves to me from across the pool. \"You made it just in time.\" \nHe takes off his shoes, stepping over the edge of the pool. But instead of falling in the water, his feet bounce lightly along the surface. \nHe takes several steps, miraculously. \n\"Emir boosted the tensile strength,\" Hermes turns to me. \"You could float an elephant in the pool.\"\nEmir walks toward us, hands outstretched.\n\"I come in peace,\" he jokes.\n\"It’s all about cohesion,\" says another girl, holding a large remote controller. \"We make the water love itself more—by strengthening the bonds,\" she says. \"We can also weaken them,\" she teases Emir.\nShe pushes a button on the controller, plunging Emir into the pool. \nEveryone laughs.\nOri stands beside me closely. I am enjoying this new world I’m being introduced to.\nSomeone is calling me.\n\"Oh—it’s my dad,\" I look at my phone. \"I’ll just be a minute,\" I tell Orion. \nI’m actually glad to hear from him. \n\"Hi dad,\" I step away from the pool. \nAs soon as he starts speaking, I realize how much I’ve changed. It’s only been two days, but I’m not relating to him in the same way I usually do. He’s asking me about the accident, of course. \nIt feels like years since we spoke. \n\"No, I’m fine dad,\" I assure him, trying to sound as normal as possible. \"Everything’s really good, great actually. I’m making new friends.\" \nIt feels good to say that.\nI drift further from the pool, heading back up to the patio, toward a row of tables.\n\"Well, it’s mostly one new friend,\" I sit at a table. \"We have a really deep—\" I’m struggling to describe it, \"um yeah, he’s a boy.\" \nI lean back in my chair. \nOri appears with a plate of lemon pie. He sits down briefly, forks up a bite, then wipes his mouth with a napkin, leaving me to my dad.\nI mention Ori to my dad.\n\"Yes,\" I say, \"like the constellation.\"\nUsually I can tell my dad anything, but I’m not ready to talk about Orion. And certainly not my memories. Still, his voice brings back a sense of normalcy. \"Dad, I’ll send you a photo of him, okay? Yes, I love you, too.\" \nI tap off the call, feeling conflicted. \nI return my phone to my pocket, bumping my fingers on the glass vial of Nepenthe. \nI shut my eyes.\nI can’t escape this, no matter how I try.\nBelow, Ori and his friends are by the pool. The patio where I’m sitting is empty.\nNo one else is nearby.\nNervously I place Nepenthe on the table—at a safe distance. It’s the first time I’ve truly examined it. The glass vial is thin and perfectly smooth, but there’s no marking on the glass. It has a clear glass lid, which I don’t dare to touch. Inside is a hazy green liquid, which transfixes me, even as I stare. \nI look up at the brick mansion from my vision. Then at the green vial of Nepenthe. What I thought was crazy has become my reality.\nI take out my phone again.\nQuickly I find a drawing of the sharp-featured, angry looking boy. I don’t want to admit it, but it’s obvious the face I’ve drawn is Tai. \nHis black eyes glare at mine. \nI glare back. \nHis features feel out-of-time. I feel how Tai grips my heart and won’t let go. In my sketch, there’s a pain in his eyes I haven’t seen in real life. \nOn the table is Ori’s plate of lemon pie and the empty chair he was sitting in. It’s a reminder of losing him. I look from the empty chair to the vial of Nepenthe, and then to my drawing of Tai.\nI can’t ignore this anymore.\nI have to deal with it. \nMaybe it’s all a hoax. Just because Tai told me a story—and gave me a perfume bottle—doesn’t prove anything. Even if somehow I drew him. Who knows, it could be broccoli juice inside the vial.\nOr anything, or nothing.\nOr poison.\nOkay, I take a breath. Let’s be smart about this. \nThink this through.\nLet’s start from the beginning. Nepenthe is real. We saw the advertisement in the park with Lauren. That proves it’s a real perfume. Okay. But does it make people forget? More to the point, would it make Ori forget our past together? There’s no proof of that. \nAnd who is Tai anyway? \nWhat if he’s an imposter? What if he’s not even a Capulet? What if he has nothing to do with Nepenthe? Just a prankster. \nThen how did he know about Orion and me? No one could have known that. \nHow did he know? \nI stare intensely at the green liquid. \nWith my fingers, I roll the glass gently, like a genie’s lamp. It feels strangely comforting. I tilt the vial sideways, watching the liquid move. \nCould it actually be a poison? But it’s a perfume, not poison, right? I’m staring at Ori’s unfurled napkin. The one he used to wipe the corner of his mouth. Why am I staring at the napkin? \nI feel on the verge of nausea.\nI need to tell Ori about this. \nHonesty is the key to our connection. All I have to do is tell Ori about Nepenthe. We’ll work this out together. \nThat’s what I’ll do. \nBut what if he reacts? \nThe power of my vision confronts me. I can’t ignore what I saw. And what I saw—undeniably—was Ori lying dead. It was as clear as day. \nI feel a trembling in my body. \nI have to protect Ori. \nI’m staring at his empty chair. If it’s not poison, then what’s the big deal? Put a drop in Ori’s napkin, where he can smell it. It won’t matter either way. At least I can say I tried to save him. \nPut a drop in his napkin?\nAm I listening to myself? \nI feel totally confused and scared. What is happening? So much was easier before any of this began. Before I remembered my past. \nMaybe oblivion is bliss. \nI tell myself to keep calm. If it’s broccoli juice, then it’s no problem. The joke’s on me. \nYeah, ha ha. \nBut what if it’s poison? \nThen I just killed the love of my life. I shut my eyes, shuddering inside. But could it really be poison? That would mean Tai is a psychopath (probably) and wants Ori dead (maybe). Tai didn’t seem to like Orion very much. Maybe he does want Orion dead. This would be an easy way to do it. \nI feel a chill race up my spine. \nAm I about to kill Ori? \nI grip Nepenthe between my thumb and forefinger, gazing into its green depth. All I see is the black storm and Ori lying dead, alongside my memories of him in the Capulet tomb. \nThey seem like the same thing. \nWhat if Tai is right? \nWhat if I do nothing—and somehow Ori dies?\nAs much as I hate it, everything Tai said was true. He even knew about my hyperosmia and how I’m melancholy. How could he know that? Those are things my friends don’t even know about me. What’s worse is what I feel in my bones: Tai is telling the truth. \nWhat I saw was real. \nOrion is destined to die. \nI have to ask myself: If it means saving Ori’s life, could I live without him? Could I?\nThat would be the ultimate sacrifice, wouldn’t it? \nCould I do that for him? \nCould I?"

I want to speak. But my mouth won’t tell a lie, and I no longer know what’s true. So I sit there, my heart on fire, looking like a deer in the headlights. \n\"Zu!\" says my love. \nI am shocked into speech. \n\"It’s something Tai gave me,\" I blurt the truth. \"It’s Nepenthe, I think.\" There. Now I’ve told the truth, no matter what happens. \nI feel my chest and hands relax.\n\"Tai?\" says Ori.\nHe perches along the edge of his chair, his body language guarded. \"What for?\" \n\"Nothing—\" I say instinctively. \nI shut my eyes, ashamed. \"To make you forget me,\" I correct myself. \n\"What?\" \nOri retracts, like a wounded animal. \n\"Tai said the only way to save you—\" I speak rapidly, \"from dying—is to make you forget me. Forget our past.

I want to press stop. I want to rewind to fifteen minutes ago, rewind to laughing in Central Park, rewind to kissing on the High Line. But I can’t rewind. \nAll I can do is tell the truth. \n\"I couldn’t risk letting you die,\" I say.\nOri doesn’t know how to respond. \"So you were going to let us die,\" he replies. \nI sit stone-like in my chair. I feel like Ori is against me. Our togetherness is evaporating, as we debate. It’s one word against another.\n\"I wasn’t going to do it—\" I try to explain.\n\"Really?\"\n\"I hadn’t decided.\"\n\"Oh my God, Zu,\" Ori says again. \n\"I couldn’t let you die—again.\"\n\"Why not?\" he says. \"What’s more important than love?\"\n\"Your life?\" I say.\n\"Is it?\" Ori replies. \nI feel the truth of his words. I feel Ori is throwing me a lifeline—to our love, to us. In Verona we died—not to save each other—but because we loved each other. I feel so grateful to be here with Ori. \n\"I thought I knew you,\" he says, warily.\nWhat?!\nNo, no, no.\n\"You do,\" I plead. \n\"No, no,\" he shakes his head. \nThe impossible is happening. I feel like I’m losing Orion. I reach out for his hand across the table. \"Ori, look at me,\" I gaze into his eyes. \"You know me—it’s me. I was scared. I didn’t know what to—\" \n\"No,\" he withdraws his hand. \n\"Ori—\" I say with presence. \nHe won’t look at me. He’s withdrawing. \n\"You’re different,\" he says. \"Something’s happened, you’ve changed. I trusted you.\" \n\"You can still trust me.\" \nOri looks at me, in a way I’ve never seen. It’s unfeeling, closed. I no longer know what he’s thinking.\n\"I have to go—\" he says abruptly.\n\"Go?\" \nHe pushes back his chair, getting up. He’s actually leaving! I’m somewhere between total panic and denial. But now I know. \nThis is worse than the tomb. \n\"Wait, Ori—\" I say. \nI can’t let him leave. \nI’m following after him. Ori walks quickly ahead of me. I hurry just to keep up. I feel I’m chasing after him, which makes it even worse. \nWe pass through the rooms of the red-brick building. Ori is nearing the front door, so I speed up. I catch him outside the entrance. \nI grab his arm. \n\"Let go—\" he says. \n\"Listen to me,\" I am almost shouting.\nI don’t let go. But I can’t reach him. \"Leave me alone,\" he says painfully.\nHe pulls his arm back, violently. I hold my grip and stare ferociously into his eyes. \"I didn’t do anything—\" I say desperately. \nOri breaks away from me.\nI take a few steps after him, then stop. \nI stand outside the brick building. I watch Ori running into the darkness, under the streetlamps. \n\"Ori—\" I call once more. "

The bicyclist falls over, shouting at me.\nI scramble away.\nSo I can’t hear Zu’s voice. \nSo I can’t hear her say my name. I don’t know where I’m going. \nJust away.\nAway from Zu. \nI rush into the park across the street, past flowerbeds and benches. I hear my footsteps running. There are people there, so I dash into the trees, the branches scratching my face and arms. I take a turn, slipping on leaves and tumbling into the dirt. \nI spring up on my feet. \nThe moonlight is breaking through the treetops. \nI feel safer here. Safer from Zu. From the person I trusted more than anyone in the world. \nHow is this happening?\nI’m catching my breath. Was Zu really going to use that green perfume? \nYes. \nShe said so. \nI see her sitting at the table. Gazing into that green vial. Then caught, like a criminal. Her guilty conscience. And all her excuses! \nIf only she’d been honest!\nHow long was she planning this?\nTrusting Tai more than me. \nTrusting a Capulet.\nI’ve never not trusted Zu. From our first Verona night, she’s been my brightest star. Ahead of me is a gravel path in the moonlight.\nI feel my future has run out. \nI start to run again, my shoes scraping along the gravel, my heart in flames. I keep running in the same direction, away from Zu. \nSuddenly New York City disappears.\nThe sky is bright as day, and I’m running on a dirt, country road. \nWhat?! \nImmediately my legs stop running. The midday sun is blazing above me. I’m sweating and there’s dirt caked on my shoes. My arms and face are sunburned. My feet are sore and blistered from walking. \nHow is this possible?\nIt’s no longer nighttime. It’s no longer New York City. It’s no longer now. \nIt’s then. \nI stare across the dusty plains. Everything is scorched in the midday heat. The slow rolling hills are golden brown, with wheat fields as far as I can see. A stray crow flies overhead. Sweat is dripping from my forehead, falling onto the barren road. \nI wipe my brow, examining the sweat. \nI know exactly where I am. \nThis is Italy, five hundred years ago. I’ve been banished from Verona after killing Tybalt. Now I’m on the road to Mantua, a nearby town. It’s a new memory, one I haven’t seen before. \nI’m in another time crossing. \nEverything I care about is behind me. In Verona. With Juliet. There’s nothing but brown road ahead. I’m tired, my head is heavy. I don’t want to go to Mantua. \nBut I don’t have a choice. \nI don’t want to leave Juliet. But I have. Everything I care about is behind me.\nIt’s exactly how I feel now. \nIs this how a time crossing happens? A similar feeling that bridges lives? Right now, my Verona and New York lives are intertwined. Like a simulation. But it’s all happening inside me.\nThe next moment, the sunlight disappears. \nI’m back in New York, on the gravel path. The moonlight shines through the trees. I’m not sweating at all, and my feet are no longer sore. I rapidly pat my chest and thighs, making sure I am real. Not far away, I hear New Yorkers talking and walking. \nYes, I’m back.\nBut I’m also different. \nBeing on the Mantua road has changed me. I can see the past more clearly. Leaving Juliet in Verona was a disaster. \nWithin days, we were both dead.\nAm I repeating the same mistake? \nIs this what Lauren meant by repetition? The second law of reincarnation. About escaping our patterns, learning from our past. Back in Verona, I was banished. \nI didn’t have a choice. \nBut I do now. \nI look in the direction of Hermes’ house. \nFor a split second, I’m back on the Mantua road. The crow flies overhead, circling the wheat fields. Under the sun-baked sky, I look longingly back to Verona. \nThis time, I take a step toward it. \nI’m choosing a different path.\nNew York reappears. My feet retrace the gravel path through the park. Back toward the Wright mansion. My steps begin slowly. \nThen faster. \nSomehow every second counts now. \nI race back to the brick mansion. \nHermes’ house is dead ahead. Its brick facade and windows light the night. Zu could still be inside. I haven’t been gone for long. \nOr have I? \nHow stupid was I to leave? \nI hurry up the stairs, then inside. I return to the patio, arriving at the stone table. \nThere’s no one there.\nWhere Zu was sitting, there’s only an empty chair. My lemon pie and fork are still on the plate. My napkin lies unfurled on the table.\nI whirl around, searching the house.\nCould she still be here? Maybe in the bathroom, or maybe outside? Or with Hermes and the others. I scan the pool and garden again. \nBut there’s no Zu. \nI don’t see her anywhere.\nI hurry through the rooms of the house, from one to another. It feels like a house of strangers, everyone is laughing and talking. \nI head out the front entrance. \n\"Orion—\"\nI turn around. It’s Wen. \n\"Where’s Zu?\" I rush toward her.\n\"She left.\"\n\"Where did she go?\" \n\"I don’t know,\" Wen seems concerned. \"She wouldn’t say a thing. Is everything okay?\" \n\"Which direction?\" I demand. \nWen shakes her head, she points up the street. In the far distance is the green sign of Nepenthe. "

          "text": "I leave right after Orion. \nAfter pacing in a circle about three times, debating what to do. Should I chase after him? Slow down, and think things through?\nOr give up on the rest of my life? \nI’ve just lost my rudder.\nTwo days ago, my life took a turn toward incredible. And now I’m lost. I snatch up Nepenthe, stumble past Wen and leave the brick building behind. \nI don’t have a plan. \nBut I can’t shrug this off.\nWhen Orion and I are together, the stars and planets are aligned. Nothing becomes something. The universe has a reason, and there’s harmony to the world. Arguing with Orion isn’t just a quarrel.\nIt’s a cosmic split. \nDo you understand what I mean? \nWith Orion, the world is right. And what’s happening now is wrong. It’s the universe going in reverse direction, cats barking and dogs meowing, the leaves falling in spring.\nThis won’t be easy to fix. \nA broken trust doesn’t repair itself. When you sing out of tune, you ruin the song. That’s why Ori reacted. On some deep level, I think he understood this. Our relationship is about truth.\nLovers never lie. \nAnd I lied. Because I was scared. But still I lied. And now I’m paying the price. \nWhen I went back in the grass.\nFor Nepenthe. That was my mistake. I knew it was wrong and I could have kept walking. But I went back anyway. \nI chose fear, instead of truth. \nThe safe thing would be to see Lauren now. That was the plan. But there’s no more plan. \nAnd I can’t do the safe thing. \nNot anymore. \nAnyway, what’s the point? Without Orion? I lower my head, turning the corner from Hermes’ house. A dozen blocks ahead of me, the green Nepenthe display glares above the Capulet store. \nIt shines like an ugly, green beacon. \nI look down at Ori’s strand of red yarn, encircled on my wrist. I feel it burning in my heart. \nI know what I have to do.\nBut I don’t want to."

I’m two blocks up the street, when a cab comes up behind me.\nI step in front, stopping it.\nI’m aware of a strange, new sensation. It’s the power of nothing to lose. \nThe cabbie is staring at me. \n\"You alright, kid?\" he says. \n\"Never better,\" I say. \nThe cabbie looks over my clothes. What does he care how I dress? Then I notice my pant legs, streaked in dirt. My hands are scraped and dirty.\nI’m lucky he even stopped. \nWe drive toward the green Nepenthe ad. I watch it growing closer. I’m furious with myself—and Zu, and everyone—for what has happened. But reliving the Mantua road has changed everything. \nI’m not running away this time. \nWe’re almost there.\nWith every block, the green Nepenthe display looms larger, more menacing. I look to the side, catching a flash of purple through the window. I whip my head, turning around. Could it be? \nIs that Zu?\n\"Stop here—\" I tell the driver. \n\"Here?\"\n\"Now—\" I shout.\nI step out into the street. \nThe cars behind brake sharply, avoiding me. I’m in their headlights, hearing their horns. But I don’t care. I step toward the sidewalk, searching where I saw the flash of purple. I’m looking up and down, through the dense New York night. The people pass and the crowd dissolves in front of me. \nBut there’s no Zu. \nI stand in the street. The traffic piles up behind me, the headlights glaring. Above me is the giant display for Nepenthe, its green liquid glowing from inside an oversized bottle. \nI take a long look. \nThat’s what Zu had in her pocket? \nIt feels downright evil. I feel Nepenthe mocking me, coloring my world with its hazy green hue. The car horns behind me blare. \n\"Hey, kid,\" the cabbie leans out the window, \"are you crazy?\"\nI get back inside the cab.\n\"Who you looking for?\" he says.\n\"Juliet,\" I tell him. \n\"Aren’t we all, buddy?\" he says. \"Aren’t we all.\" \nI sink down into the backseat, as we travel the last blocks to the Capulet store. The gauzy green of Nepenthe coats the pavement of the intersection. \nI’m about to jump out, when my phone rings. I answer on the first tone.\n\"Ori, I need to talk to you—\"\nIt’s Hermes.\nI’ve never been so disappointed to hear from him.\n\"Not now,\" I say.\n\"Yes now,\" he says.\n\"NOT NOW.\"\n\"Orion,\" Hermes says.\nI pause. \nHermes never uses my full name.\n\"I need you to listen to me,\" he says gently. \"As your friend, I need you to listen.\"\nI wait silently.\nOutside the cab, the Capulet store drifts by. I watch it from the window. \"I need you to come back,\" says Hermes. \"Come back to the house.\"\n\"You don’t know what’s happening!\"\n\"No, I do know.\"\nWhat is he talking about?\n\"And I need you to come back.\"\n\"Hermes, you don’t understand,\" I tell him. \"I can’t turn away from this.\"\n\"Yes you can,\" says Hermes. \"I understand. Trust me, I understand.\" The cab drives on, aimlessly. We are leaving  the Capulet store behind.\n\"Orion,\" Hermes says earnestly. \"As your friend, have I ever let you down? For real.\"\nI look out the window.\n\"This is important,\" he says.\nI stare down, ending the call. \nThe black screen stares back. Everything is telling me I need to find Zu. But Hermes is telling me something else. And I trust my friend. \nI am torn in two.\n\"Turn around,\" I tell the cabbie."

I guess it was my mind, playing tricks on me. \nI cross a green-hued intersection, outside the Capulet storefront. Something is different about me. It’s like someone else is in charge. The crowd seems to part and flow around me. I gaze directly ahead, single-minded, without wavering. \nOutside the all-glass building, I look up.\nThe glass walls rise three stories high. I stand there in the breezy, humid night. Inside I can see the guests at the reception. \nNow what? \nI’m not sure. \nBut I have something to settle. Two empty wine bottles are standing by the curb. I grab one by the neck. It feels heavy in my hand. \nI hurl it immediately at the glass. \nIt slams against the door, smashing the bottle into pieces. But the door stands intact, with only a thin, winding crack in the glass.\nI stand outside, fists clenched. \nSomeone arrives rapidly at the door. I can’t see who they are, until the door swings open. \nIt’s Tai. \nI didn’t think he’d actually be here. \nBehind him is a packed room of guests. Tai steps outside carefully, observing the crack in the door with amazement. \nHe smiles proudly at me. \n\"Not bad,\" he says. \nI throw the second bottle at his head. \nTai catches it in midair. He spins it to read the wine label, putting on impressed airs.\nWhat an asshole. \nI don’t know my next move. I just start walking toward him. I don’t know what Tai wants from me. But I want to get to the bottom of this. \n\"No Orion?\" Tai observes. \nHe sets down the wine bottle. \nI’m not afraid of Tai anymore. I walk straight up and take a swing at his head. My fist connects with his face. Tai bends downward, to the side. He doesn’t seem hurt. But that felt really good. For everything that he’s done. \n\"Welcome home,\" says Tai, recovering. \nHe turns his back to me and walks inside. \"Come on, Zu. I have something to show you.\"\nI have no response. But I follow.\nIn the low white ambience, the Capulet store is a cross between a royal palace and a mausoleum. From end to end are the most elegant-looking people in the brightest and boldest fashions. They smile pleasantly at me, as I pass. The whole place feels so beautifully decadent, like a futuristic garden of Eden. \nI kind of love it. \nBut it’s definitely not me. \nTai shoots me a mischievous wink. I pause momentarily. The door is still open behind me. \nI could always leave. \nBut there’s something I need to know.\nTai ascends a spiraling staircase. From behind him, I observe how his fist clenches, opening and closing again, as if he's in pain. Something about this gesture feels familiar. At the top of the stairs, I meet Lucrezia who wears a pretty white dress. \nShe gives me a warm, sisterly smile. \nA frosted double door opens, and Tai and Lucrezia enter. I follow them across the threshold. \nThe doors close behind me."

The glass bottles are round, oblong and dozens of even stranger shapes.\nI take a curious step forward. \nSurprisingly, I don’t smell a thing. I guess all the fragrance is trapped inside the bottles.\nLucrezia comes up beside me.\n\"Perfume has always been part of life,\" she guides me toward a table of antique perfume bottles. \"Even these bottles have a history.\" \nShe points to the bottle stoppers, ornately shaped as flowers, shells and animals. \"This one,\" Lucrezia draws my attention to a dagger-like stopper, \"was even used in the murder of a famous Italian noblewoman, sent to her death by a jealous lover.\" \nShe ushers me toward another table. On its surface are modern-looking vials.\n\"Do you want to try?\" Tai asks.\nI wrinkle my mouth, as if indifferent. I’m reminded how little I trust either of them. But at the same time, I am impressed being here. Lucrezia directs me toward a bottle filled with a light purple liquid. \nShe places her hand on the lid.\n\"This is Evangeline,\" she says.\nLucrezia smiles, lifting the glass lid. She gently takes hold of my wrist. I debate whether I should pull away. How do I know it isn’t dangerous? \nI don’t. But I don’t care.\nThe lab, the perfumes, whatever the purple Evangeline is. It’s all too captivating. \nA spray of purple mist moistens my wrist. Lucrezia nudges my hand toward my nose. For a long second or two, I hold my breath. \nThen I inhale.\nOh, my goodness.\nI’ve never smelled anything like this. \nIt’s not just an aroma. It’s an all-senses experience. I feel like I’ve awakened in a luscious garden, with growing plants and blossoms all around me. I feel like I am the garden. Around me, light purple bubbles, shapes and insects float through the air. \nI can’t tell if they’re real. \nOr not.\nThis isn’t a fragrance. It’s an explosion of life.\n\"Now tell us, Zu,\" I hear Tai’s voice. \"What are the main ingredients of Evangeline?\" My first reaction is: I have no clue. I’m just floating in the purple garden, absorbed by the earthy scents of living things. \nGradually I focus my attention. \"Jasmine,\" I mumble, \"cinnamon. And cedar.\"\nTai breaks into a beautiful grin. \n\"You see,\" he says, \"you were born for this!\" It’s the happiest I’ve seen him. \"You left out orange blossom, but that’s okay.\"\nStrangely, I feel happy too. \nI smile, then instantly wish I hadn’t. \nAs if I’ve admitted something about myself. But I am feeling more comfortable. Tai and Lucrezia seem to understand a part of me that so few people do. Certainly not my parents, and maybe not even Orion. \nI allow myself an unpleasant thought. \nIs it possible that Tai and Lucrezia are at least partly right? Is it possible I passed up another future? When I chose Romeo in Verona. \nWhat if I hadn’t met Romeo? \nOr at least not fallen madly in love with him? If that’s even possible! But maybe, somehow, it was. If I had returned to my chamber, instead of accompanying my father in greeting the guests at the Capulet ball. I might not have bumped into Romeo. Our meeting was a matter of moments, of inches.\nOf seconds.\nMaybe I would have remained with the Capulets, helping them develop their perfumes. Maybe I would have helped people remember their past. \nMaybe I would have lived.\nThis alternate possibility shakes me. It’s like another life that I could have lived. But then, there wouldn’t have been Romeo. There wouldn’t have been our love. That incredible, life-shattering love. \nThere wouldn’t have been us. \nI’m realizing the power of choices.\nFor the first time."

I follow a few steps behind. \nWe descend the stone stairway. \nI’ve never seen this part of the building. \"When we first moved here,\" Hermes tells me, \"I used to go down here. It was my hiding spot.\"\nDirectly ahead of us, at the base of the stairs, is an imposing stone wall. As if the stairs led to nowhere. We’ve reached a dead end.\nHermes extends his hand.\nHis fingertips are about to reach the wall, when the stones ripple away from his hand. His fingers pass straight through the stone. \nIt’s another hologram.\nOf course.\n\"This was my first one,\" Hermes grins broadly, stepping through the rippling wall. I’m left standing by myself, at the base of the stairs. \n I inch my fingers forward.\nAgain the stones seem to shimmer. Soon my hand and elbow are immersed in the wall.\nHermes drags me through.\nI’m in a large room, with a long hallway extending into the distance. The walls are built entirely of stone. \"This is the original basement,\" Hermes says. \"When I found it, it was all walled up.\" He laughs, \"With real stones.\"\n\"Why are we here?\"\n\"Look below your feet,\" he says.\nI step backward gingerly. I notice a large engraving on the stone floor, a simple carving of a tree. \"Look familiar?\" Hermes smiles.\nI observe the engraved branches. \nIt does seem familiar. \nLike something I’ve seen before. \"This is the Montague emblem,\" Hermes tells me. \nOh.\nWait.\n\"It’s no hologram, Ori—\"\nHermes steps forward, seeing my face.\n\"There was a time,\" Hermes says bluntly, \"when the Montagues were a family. But we’ve evolved beyond the bloodline.\"\n\"We?\" I say.\nHow does Hermes know my past? Was he listening to my conversation with Zu? On the patio?\n\"You’re a Montague,\" I play along.\n\"As much as you, Ori.\"\nI’m in no mood for jokes.\n\"I wouldn’t kid you,\" Hermes says. \n\"Yes you would.\"\n\"Not on this.\"\nHe steps up the stone hallway.\nTwo rows of holographic figures rush toward us, along the length of the hall. They stand at intervals, spanning the entire stone hallway. \"Throughout history, the Montagues have gone by different names in different places,\" Hermes says. \"But it’s no longer your name that makes you a Montague, it’s what’s in your heart.\"\nWe walk between the rows.\nIt’s a virtual timeline to the past. \nI see a woman in a Victorian dress and a man in a bowler hat. Hermes gazes at the figures, who turn their heads, staring back. \"The Montagues were women and men,\" he says, \"who shared a love for truth. Some were famous. But most worked behind the scenes.\"\nI pass between the figures.\nTwo young women, one blond and one red-haired, stand in European dresses. Hermes pauses, glancing affectionately at the two women. \"I wouldn’t be showing you any of this,\" Hermes says. \"But when you showed up with Zu tonight—well, I knew.\"\n\"Knew what?\"\n\"You’d seen your past.\"\nI stop at once. \nHow can Hermes know?\nAnd why is he bringing up the Montagues? Here in New York City.\nWe pass holograms wearing the garments of medieval monks and nuns. Others wear traditional Indian and Asian  clothing. Further back are Greeks, Persians and Africans. \"These are Initiates of the Montague stream,\" Hermes says respectfully. \"The Montague Initiates reincarnate, again and again.\"\nThe holographic row reorganizes.\nAll the figures dissolve, except for two. A man and woman. They zoom rapidly forward, stopping just before one another. \nThey face each other, curiously.\n\"This is Simon of Carthage,\" Hermes looks at each, \"and Elizabeth of Hanover. They lived centuries apart. Both devoted their lives to the Montague ideals of freedom and truth. And both were the same person,\" says Hermes. \"Simon was born again as Elizabeth.\"\nThe two holograms peer keenly at each other, as if gazing into a mirror. \n\"In time, Elizabeth passed on as well. But don’t worry,\" Hermes winks. \"She’ll be back.\"\nThe figures fade out.\nTwo others take their place. \nFrom opposite ends of the hall, they speed forward to meet in front of us. One wears an Arabian keffiyeh, the other a modern dress shirt and fitted trousers. \"Mamet Zayn,\" Hermes introduces me. \"He fought against the forces of intolerance, many centuries ago. Now he develops renewable technologies.\" The modern incarnation has a blur over the face. \"For reasons of privacy, I can’t reveal their identity.\"\nHermes smiles at Mamet Zayn.\n\"Now, Ori—check this out,\" says Hermes.\nFrom the end of the hallway, a lone figure approaches us, at a casual pace. It’s a teenage boy, with flowing hair. He’s dressed casually in the Italian Renaissance style.\nI draw toward him, mesmerized, until we are face to face. His soft features regard me. \nWe examine each other, carefully.\nThis is me, I know.\nIn Verona. \n\"Welcome home, Ori,\" says Hermes.\nBeside the hologram of Romeo Montague, another boy strides up brazenly. He is a bright star, smiling broadly. He looks at Hermes, who gazes back.\nShudders race through me.\nI know this boy.\n\"Mercutio—\" I say.\nOf course.\n\"I wasn’t a Montague then,\" Hermes bows his head. \"But I was your friend.\"\nMy affection for Hermes spills over. \nI had assumed my life was a journey I made on my own. Now I’m realizing I was never alone. My loved ones, my friends, were with me all along. \n\"As always,\" says Hermes."

The real story is more complex.\" \nIn the hologram, I see Verona’s Piazza delle Erbe and townspeople in the marketplace.\n\"In those days,\" Hermes says, \"your family was all- important to your future. The Bachs all became great musicians. The Medicis were the banker patrons of Europe. And the Capulets. Well, the Capulets understood the secrets of perfume.\"\nI gaze into the images. \nWorkers in Renaissance dress are busy in an old-fashioned perfume lab. Peculiar bottles and metal vats occupy the room. \n\"For centuries, the Capulets were the masters of fragrance. But successes made them proud,\" says Hermes. \"They began to think they were superior.

Workers in simple clothing harvest flowers, under a shining sun.\n\"But weren’t the families enemies?\" I backtrack.\n\"Everyone thinks so,\" Hermes laughs.\nHe shakes his head. \"All because of Shakespeare! He didn’t even know us! He wrote his play based on a story he overheard in a tavern in Spain! The Montagues and Capulets were partners,\" Hermes explains. \"In fact, the trouble only started around the time you and Juliet were born in Verona.\"\nI watch Hermes, curiously wondering how Mercutio became this person.

Finally we stopped supplying them! This led to the worst feuding, brawls breaking out in the streets of Verona.\" \nI see two bands of townspeople, fighting desperately in the piazza. \"Why was it dangerous?\" I am absorbed.\nHermes pauses, gazing at me.\n\"Ori, as you know,\" he says, \"past lives are traumatic! Your most devastating memories—everything you want to forget—come rushing back. If you’re not ready for this—and most people aren’t—it’s honestly dangerous. Especially if you accelerate the process with a perfume! The Capulets were having horrible accidents. Some of their customers went insane, became delusional, even committed suicide! They couldn’t handle what they saw about their past.\"\nHe looks into the hologram. \nA woman holds a vial of red liquid. \nShe looks into a mirror, deranged. Suddenly she shatters the mirror violently with her fist. In another scene, a poorly dressed man shouts hysterically in a crowded marketplace. A third person balances at the edge of an open window, before leaping into the street below.\n\"Imagine killing someone,\" says Hermes, \"or being killed in your past life. Betraying someone, or being betrayed. That’s not easy to remember.\" \nI recall the horror of seeing Juliet in the tomb. \"By selling their memory perfumes,\" Hermes says, \"the Capulets broke the Prime Law.\"\nHe stops walking.\n\"You never show anyone their past lives,\" Hermes looks directly at me. \"Everyone has to remember for themselves.

Landon says something I can’t hear. I’m glad—I have nothing to say. I put my arms around him, crossing my wrists behind his neck. \nLandon moves to kiss me, and I let him.\nHis arms grasp my waist as we kiss. I feel our lips together. The lights and kiss are one big blur. \nLife is one big blur. \nIsn’t it? \nSuddenly Kimmo is at my side.\nShe’s pulling on my arm.

Jaden and Aisha come rushing out the basement entrance. They jump in the car, Jaden in the backseat beside me.\nWe drive in the humid night.\nI slink down into the seat, reclining. I rest my arm loosely out the window, the strand of red yarn still wrapped around my wrist. \nI watch it flutter in the wind. \nI’m not listening to the others. All I hear is the music in my head: \n\"You’d turn back but the night is long \nI’d come to you but I’ve lost this song\"\nCasually, I untie the yarn.\nI watch it flutter, delicately, before the wind whisks it away. I stare into the mid-distance, unblinking.\nWe drive on for blocks. Outside my apartment, Kimmo drops me off. I head into the building alone and up the long elevator ride.\nI don’t feel blissful anymore. \nI don’t feel carefree.\nI enter my bedroom, crash onto my bed and flop my head on my pillow. I stare up at the ceiling.\nI don’t feel anything at all."

          "narrator": "Ori",
          "text": "We’ve entered a beige room.\nIt’s a modern room, just beyond the stone hallway, furnished with large white sofas and chairs. Immediately I feel a sharp stabbing through my heart. I double over, one knee to the ground.\nI shut my eyes tightly. \nI feel like someone, or something, has just died. But I don’t know why. \n\"Something’s wrong,\" I look urgently at Hermes.\nHermes eyes me, compassionately.\n\"It can be painful,\" he says, \"when timelines don’t go as planned.\"\nI’ve never felt this kind of pain.\nNot even in the tomb. \nHermes is crossing the room, toward a large wooden table, where a holographic map of New York City appears. The map rotates, zooming out effortlessly into a display of North America.\n\"Enough holograms,\" I say.\n\"You need to see this, Ori.\"\n\"Not now—\" I say.\nMy heart feels like it’s bleeding out.\nHermes stands there, kindly.\n\"There’s no other time,\" he says.\nGradually I look up. On the hologram, a blue dot hovering near Los Angeles slowly extends into a line, moving toward New York City. \"This is a timeline,\" Hermes says gently. \"Everyone has one. It starts at your birth and runs through your life.\" \nNow a second line appears.\nThis one is purple, moving toward New York from Hong Kong. \"This is Zu’s timeline,\" Hermes says to me. \"Basically, a timeline is a series of appointments. Places you need to be, and people you need to meet, to move toward your destiny.\"\nI am watching Zu’s purple line.\n\"This is you and Zu moving to New York,\" Hermes points to the map. The purple line arrives in New York, where my blue line is waiting. \"Your first appointment,\" Hermes looks satisfied. \"It was supposed to be one year earlier. But no real harm.\" \nI’m reminded what Zu said about her dad’s job being delayed, by one year. \"I know it was a difficult year for you,\" Hermes says.\nThe map swivels, hovering above Jack’s Coffee in the Meatpacking District. \nThe blue and purple lines are converging again.\n\"This is your second appointment,\" Hermes observes the map. \"The moment you and Zu meet. A bit tricky, but still successful.\"\n\"Tricky?\" I say. \"It was perfect—\" \nI rub my chest, which is still aching.\n\"Hardly,\" Hermes gives me a look. \"That’s the thing with appointments of destiny. People never know when they miss one. They just go on with their lives! But you and Zu nearly missed this one.\" \nHe points at the map.\n\"That meeting at Jack’s wasn’t your first chance to meet,\" Hermes says. \"It was your last.\"\n\"Last?\" I eye Hermes, across the table. \"What does that even mean?\" \nHe holds my gaze patiently. \n\"Answer one question for me,\" he says. \"When was the first time you saw Zu?\"\n\"At Jack’s Coffee,\" I answer, obviously.\n\"No, it wasn’t.\"\nI swallow, hard.\nI resent the idea that anyone—especially Hermes—could know more about my past than me. I try to recall another time I could have seen Zu. \nBut nothing comes.\n\"Two weeks before Jack’s,\" Hermes reminds me. \"We went to a party, before school started.\" I remember that night. It was a fourth floor apartment, in the summer heat. It wasn’t a huge party. But crowded enough so you couldn’t see everyone. \n\"Didn’t someone,\" he says, \"catch your eye?\"\nInstantly I remember. \nEverything.\nIt was around midnight. I was chatting with Shanti and Wen, in a corner of the kitchen. Across the crowd, I saw a girl wearing a baseball cap. It was only a glimpse—I didn’t see her clearly—but something about her captured me. It was the way she moved.\nI liked her immediately. \nHow could I forget this? \nBut now I’m remembering it exactly. \nIn my memory, the girl in the baseball cap has purple hair. Oh my goodness—it is Zu. Our eyes almost meet, for a quarter of a second, from opposite sides of the room. I leave Shanti and Wen. The girl in the cap is moving toward me. Our paths are converging, near the entrance to the apartment.\nWe’re about to meet.\nIt’s inevitable.\nNow I remember!\nAt the last moment, Angelo barrels between us. He whirls around, spilling his drink on my shirt. \nI’m completely soaked. \nI take my eye from Zu. It’s only for a second, but when I look again, she’s gone. Angelo is patting my shirt, trying to dry me off. I shake loose, descending the stairway, all the way to the street. \nBut the girl in the baseball cap is gone.\n\"What a shame,\" Hermes shakes his head. \"It was a perfect set up! Two young lovers meeting across a room. But even the best-laid plans—\"\n\"Why didn’t you say anything!\"\n\"I couldn’t.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Ori, you know better than anyone,\" Hermes tells me, \"about magical meetings. The stars have to align! That’s how you know it’s meant to be.\" \nWe both pause, reflecting.\n\"Like in Verona,\" he says.\n\"How do you know all this?\" I say.\nHermes grows silent.\n\"We have friends in common, Ori,\" he says.\nHermes stands across the table, his timeless gaze piercing. \nA silence is falling over the room. \"Friends who can help us,\" he says. The texture of the room is beginning to change. I am aware of a bluish white light, seemingly above our heads. The air is filling with light.\nWe both stand perfectly still.\n\"Do you feel that, Ori?\"\nI feel something.\n\"Is that them?\"\nHermes keeps his eyes on mine. \"Yes,\" he says, softly. \"It’s them.\"\n\"Who are they?\" I say, without moving.\nThe bluish light is enveloping the room. It brings a timeless, multi-dimensional quality. Like a bridge between heaven and earth.\n\"They are Montagues,\" Hermes looks directly in my eyes, \"who are in-between lives. They’ve died and haven’t been born again.\"\nI am bathed in blue light.\nIn this light, I feel the past, present and future, all happening at once. I feel Zu and myself—from Verona to now and into the future—and others too. I can feel Hermes, Lauren—my sister—and millions of others, their hopes and their love and their pain.\nHermes says, softly, \"Those between lives can see things we can’t see. The rules of the physical world don’t apply to them. They don’t communicate with words, but ideas, thoughts, feelings. They try to guide us toward our appointments.\"\nThe blue light is beginning to fade. \nI don’t know how much time has passed. But something closer to normal is returning. \"With their help,\" Hermes glances upward, \"and the help of others, we tried a second time to connect you two.\"\nI’m still recovering from the blue light. \nAnd the memory of Zu in the baseball cap.\n\"One week later,\" says Hermes. \"You went to the Met on a Saturday.\" I quickly recall my trip to the museum. \"Zu was there?\" I say surprised.\n\"No. But how did you get there?\" \nI try to remember.\n\"Uber,\" I say.\nI remember the moment. I’d had a sudden inspiration to visit the Met. I was about to confirm my ride. But then, I had second thoughts.\nI hesitated. \nFor thirty seconds.\n\"Thirty seconds too long,\" says Hermes. \"If you hadn’t waited, you would have been pooled with Zu. She was going uptown, and you would have struck up a conversation. You would have gone to the Met together, on that Saturday.\"\n\"It was only thirty seconds!\" I argue.\n\"Destiny doesn’t wait,\" Hermes says. \"Instead of Zu’s Uber picking you up on Gansevoort Street, it picked up someone else on 26th Avenue.\"\n\"Who?\" I feel weirdly jealous.\n\"A businessman from Toronto,\" he shrugs. \"It doesn’t matter. They didn’t say a word to each other.\" I suddenly feel deeply saddened, about this day at the museum that Zu and I never had. \n\"I guess it’s silly to feel sad,\" I say aloud, \"about something that never happened.\"\n\"Not at all,\" Hermes disagrees. \nI look up, quietly.\n\"Sometimes the things that didn’t happen are the saddest things in life,\" he says, honestly.\nHermes claps his hands. \n\"But you did meet.\" \nOn the holographic map, the purple and blue lines have converged, in a kind of spiral. \"That’s what matters! On your final chance—that morning at Jack’s Coffee—you and Zu met each other.\"\nThe two lines spiral together, moving through Central Park and Times Square. But when they reach Hermes’ house, they burst and fizzle. The two lines spiral away, drunkenly, in different directions.\n\"Uh oh,\" Hermes leans forward.\n\"This is worse than I thought,\" he looks concerned. \"Your timelines are separating.\"\nI feel the wrenching in my gut. \nWhat I’m seeing on the map is exactly what I’ve been feeling, since my argument with Zu. With every hour Zu feels further away. \n\"You and Zu have a third appointment,\" Hermes says seriously. \"This appointment is the reason you met. Do you know what it is?\"\nI know exactly.\nMy wrenching gut won’t quit.\n\"The Lights,\" I say."

          "text": "On the holographic map, the blue and purple lines continue spinning apart. The two lines drift slowly away, aimlessly.\nLike unmoored ships.\nHermes takes a puzzled step back. \"What’s this about?\" he asks me. \"The Capulets?\"\n\"No,\" I am certain. \"It’s something else.\" \nHermes closes his eyes, thinking. \nHe grabs a narrow, black case from a shelf across the room. Hermes carries it deliberately, placing it on a table between the sofas. \n\"Open this,\" he says.\n\"What’s inside?\"\n\"My backup plan,\" Hermes says.\nOn the side of the case are three latches. I flip them open hesitantly, then raise the lid. \nWhat’s inside makes no sense. \nIt’s a feeling similar to when I first imagined the white dress. Inside the case is an elegantly crafted sword, with a silver blade and black hilt.\n\"This is Adagio,\" Hermes tells me.\nAdagio, I think.\nIt means gracefully.\n\"It’s your sword, from Verona.\"\nI sit backward, quickly.\n\"It’s not the original,\" Hermes rephrases. \"But I retrieved the exact details. This is a 3D printed version made of titanium.\"\nReluctantly, I lift the sword from its case. The grip sits comfortably in my hand. \nI feel different holding Adagio. \nI stand from the sofa, extending the sword in my arm, feeling its weight and balance. I nearly smile, but I’m struck by a flash of memory. I see the Piazza delle Erbe and Adagio killing Tybalt.\nIt’s what led to my banishment. \nTo my separation from Juliet. To finding her body in the tomb. \n\"Why give me this?\" I say, angrily.\nI drop Adagio to the floor. \n\"Because,\" says Hermes, patiently, \"our plans have changed and you need to be ready.\"\n\"For what?\"\n\"For anything.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" I glare.\nI walk away from Adagio.\n\"Timelines aren’t a joke, Ori,\" Hermes watches me. \"They can literally change the future. Your appointment with Zu is bigger than just yourselves.\"\n\"I’m not a fighter,\" I shake my head.\nHermes says, intently: \"The Romeo I knew was a lover and a fighter.\"\n\"I killed people!\" I say. \"Including myself.\"\nThis is why I never joined the fencing team. Even after all of Hermes’ invitations. I never wanted anything to do with those memories.\nI pick up Adagio, returning it to its case. \nHermes grabs my wrist. Our eyes meet inches apart. His other hand strikes me hard in the chest, and I’m thrown backward through the air. \nI land behind the sofa, sliding across the floor. \nHermes is advancing upon me. \"The sword doesn’t matter. I printed it to prove a point.\"\n\"Are you crazy?\" I sit up.\nHermes throws Adagio at me. \nI ignore it. Hermes grabs my shoulder, catapulting me across the room again. He kicks Adagio toward me. I pick it up, desperately.\nAnd scramble to my feet. \n\"What is wrong with you?\" I hold Adagio vaguely forward, ready to defend myself.\nHermes drops his hands, peacefully.\n\"If I’m completely honest,\" he chuckles. \"You were a lot tougher in Verona. I’m not saying you need to kill anyone! But we need your killer instinct.\"\nI keep Adagio lowered. \n\"In Verona, you had that,\" Hermes says. \"But your instincts are stuck in your past. We need to retrieve them, if you’re going to help Zu.\" \n\"How?\" I fume.\nI’m tired of Hermes’ mysteries.\n\"We’ve already started,\" he winks.\n\"I’m sick of your riddles.\"\nHermes laughs at me. \"But what are you gonna do about it?\"\nI feel conflicted and uncertain. \n\"This is the kind of hesitation,\" Hermes smirks, \"that’s going to lose you Zu. The way you lost Juliet,\" he mocks me, \"in Verona.\"\nI can’t believe his words. \nSomething snaps.\nI lunge at Hermes with Adagio, hilt forward and the blade raised. I don’t have a plan.\nI don’t even think.\nHermes meets my attack, grabbing my wrists and throwing my weight against the wall. We stand together, our hands locked on Adagio.\n\"Now, Ori—\" Hermes shouts in my face. \nI push back, with all my strength.\n\"Feel what you’re feeling!\"\nAll I feel is my rage. \n\"Feelings are your link,\" Hermes says to me, point blank, \"to retrieving your past. But you have to feel them completely!\" \nI feel my rage at Hermes. My anger at the Capulets—my anger at Zu. My anger for everything that’s gone wrong. In this life and the last.\n\"Stop holding back!\" Hermes shouts.\nI’m furious, and ashamed—because I know he’s right. I am holding back. But why? To stay in control? To not hurt anyone? \nI feel something erupting.\n\"Good, Ori—\" says Hermes, \"now go deeper!\" I can barely hear him. My anger drowns out his voice.\nIt’s the anger of killing.\nHermes’ face is beginning to morph. \nI no longer see Hermes, but the face of Tybalt, Juliet’s brother. I nearly panic. Is this a trap? Is it actually Tybalt who’s lured me to this room? \"Stay with your anger,\" I hear Hermes speaking through Tybalt’s face. \"These are your retrieval memories.\"\nThe beige room is disappearing. \nNow there’s a bright blue sky, the wooden floor is turning to earth-colored stone. The table and comfortable sofas evaporate, revealing the canvas awnings and storefronts of the Piazza delle Erbe. \nI’ve just stabbed Tybalt. \nMy hatred of him rages in my veins.\nI smell Tybalt’s blood. \nWhy am I remembering this? I never wanted to feel this way again. \"Don’t shy away, Ori,\" I hear Hermes command. \"This is a part of you. Part of retrieval is remembering unpleasant things.\"\nTybalt shakes free of Adagio. \n\"You haven’t killed me,\" says Tybalt, now in his own voice. \"It’s hardly a wound. Now fight!\" Tybalt launches at me violently. I scamper away, dodging his blows raining down on me. Nothing of the beige room remains. It’s only the piazza and a fight to the death.\n\"Hermes!\" I shout.\nTybalt charges at me, barely missing. \"It’s only a memory, Montague,\" he says. \"You can’t be hurt.\" Tybalt slams his sword hilt into my chest, knocking me down. A burning pain rips into my lungs. \nI gasp for air.\n\"That hurt—\" I call out. \nTybalt rages after me, attacking with his rapier. It cuts a swath through the wall of a building. \"You’re reliving it, Ori,\" says Tybalt, hammering me again. \"But it’s not real pain. It’s just the memory of the experience.\" Tybalt smashes my jaw with the base of his sword. \nI collapse, tasting blood. I feel the jagged edge of a tooth, rolling on my tongue.\nI spit it out. \n\"This feels real,\" I cough, my head splitting.\n\"That’s because it was,\" says Tybalt, arrogantly. \"Now get up, Montague!\" \nI feel fury, hearing my old name. \nMy hatred of Tybalt is renewed. I labor to my feet, wielding Adagio. Tybalt attacks, but surprisingly, I repel him easily. We battle along the sun-caked storefronts of the Piazza delle Erbe.\nI’m using Adagio with a skill I’ve forgotten.\n\"Feel how your body moves,\" Tybalt instructs, as he smashes a wooden pole to bits. \"In your movements, there is the memory, the knowledge of fighting—but more importantly, the instinct and will to fight. That’s what you want to retrieve.\"\n\"Like this?\" I clobber Tybalt backward with my forearm. He bleeds from his nose. \n\"That’s it,\" he smiles.\nTybalt beckons me on. We fight ferociously. I gain the upper hand, until Tybalt retakes it. I land two more punches to his face.\n\"Be aware of every move,\" Tybalt says, through his dirty, bleeding face. \"You can only retrieve what you feel. Feel how Adagio feels in your hand. Feel how you attack and defend, feel your stance, the way your feet move. But most importantly, feel how much you care! How much you would give—for what you care about most!\"\nEverything, I think.\nTybalt slashes at me.\nHe knocks me down, crushing his knee in my ribs. I roll to the side, dodging his killing blow. \nWe rage on, metal to metal. \nI would give everything.\nI feel my sweat and hate. I swing away in unchecked fury, overwhelming Tybalt, until he can no longer defend himself. My next thrust skewers his flesh.\nEverything.\nTybalt collapses, my sword in his side.\nHe lifts his dying head.\n\"That’ll do,\" I hear Hermes’ voice again.\nThe Piazza delle Erbe wavers once, then disappears. The objects and tables of the beige room reform before my eyes. We’re standing in the exact position where we began. \nHermes releases me from his grip.\nHe’s not bloody or bleeding. \nAnd neither am I. \nAlthough my chest aches like fire. \"My friend,\" Hermes says soberly, \"that was beautiful.\"\nRays of sunshine fall on the wooden floor. \"How long has it been?\" I say.\n\"Seven hours,\" Hermes checks his watch. \"Time in retrieval is slower than time in the present.\" \nHe retakes Adagio from me, swinging it at my head. I duck and grab a broomstick. I sweep his legs with the broom, flipping Hermes to the ground. \n\"I guess it worked,\" he laughs.\n\"But how did we stand here?\" I’m amazed. \"For seven hours?\" \nHermes picks himself up. \n\"It’s all part of the training,\" he says simply. I want to ask more, but I don’t even know my question. \"This is about more than you and Zu,\" Hermes says. \"The Montagues and Capulets are a small act in a much larger play.\"\nHe hands me Adagio, by the hilt.\n\"So what now?\" he says.\n\"We find Zu.\""

It feels somewhat surreal, but I’m in my own world, and I hardly notice everyone’s eyes on me. \nWe enter the main doors. \nI’m only here for Zu. \nBut in the hallways, I can’t ignore the stares. Kids at open lockers stop what they’re doing, looking. I hear my name whispered, a dozen times.\nMs. Hernandez, the principal, greets me, \"Good to see you, Orion,\" she smiles enthusiastically. I say hello, smiling and nearly stopping for her.\nBut not quite. \nI can’t stop. For anyone.\nNot until I find Zu.\nI notice banners for The Lights, hung alongside the sides of the hallway.\nThe Lights.\nOur third appointment.\n\"It’s only been one night,\" I turn to Hermes. \"Our timelines can’t be that split, right?\"\nHermes shrugs, uncertainly.\nWe enter the student lounge. Groups of students are sitting around wooden tables, eating snacks and hanging out before class. Some of them look up.\nI can feel them watching.\nSitting at a far table is Zu.\nShe’s sitting with some friends, her head tilted downward. My heart lifts, just seeing her.\nIt feels like ages, since last night.\nBut there she is.\nLike always.\nZu wears a black dress, which comes to a sharp end below her thigh. She doesn’t see me yet. Surrounding her are two girls I don’t know. Sitting beside them, for some reason, is Landon.\nI feel I’m seeing Zu for the first time. She’s talking in her easy, natural way. She brushes her purple hair, which covers her eyes, to one side.\nI reach her table.\nZu turns to me. Her eyes are circled in dark eyeshadow. But it’s her gaze that makes me freeze. Something is so wrong. Zu is looking in my eyes. \nBut without love.\nWithout anything.\n\"Hey Ori,\" she says.\nHer voice isn’t warm, or cold. \nIt’s just empty. The way you would speak to someone you hardly know. I shift to my back foot.\n\"Zu—\" I look in her eyes.\n\"That’s me,\" she replies.\nMy stomach plummets. Is Zu trying to punish me? For last night? For running away? \"I was hoping I’d find you here,\" I explain, uncomfortably. \nZu’s friends look toward her.\n\"I guess you did,\" she smiles. \nBut it’s an empty smile. \nA smile for anyone. There’s an awkward pause at the table. I try to understand what’s happening. Zu doesn’t seem troubled. But it’s like she’s gone. \nSomething has taken her place.\n\"Can we talk alone?\" I suggest. \nZu’s friend with the tattoo observes me in a friendly way. I feel she’s on my side.\n\"These are my friends,\" Zu says. \"If you want to say something, you can say it in front of everyone.\"\n\"Oh—I get it,\" I say. \"This is part of your rehearsal. For The Lights.\" I look at Landon and almost laugh. I don’t really believe this.\nBut it’s my only explanation. \nNeither Zu nor her friends say another word. I stand without moving, afraid to reveal my emotions. \"Would you give us a moment?\" I say to her friends. Now Landon is looking at me. \"Hey Ori—\" he says. \"She said no.\"\nI turn my head.\n\"What are you doing here?\" I say.\nLandon stares back.\n\"What are you doing here?\" he replies.\nOh wow. \nIs this really happening?\nMy eyes hurry from Landon to Zu. I don’t know what’s going on here. But it feels so wrong. I hear one of Zu’s friends whisper to the other, \"Zu and Ori, or Zu and Landon?\"\nZu’s stare is frigid now.\n\"Is Ori bothering you?\" asks Landon.\nI’ve had enough of him. \"Listen—Landon,\" I say. \"I don’t know what you think is happening, but just—\" I pause, for the right words, \"shut up.\"\n\"It’s okay, Landon,\" says Zu. \nI can’t believe my ears. \nI reach across the table, taking Zu by the hand. Incredibly, Landon grabs my arm. \n\"Hands off, Ori—\" \nI seize Landon’s elbow, twisting hard. I drag him forward onto the tabletop, until his cheek is pressed down hard against the surface. \nI hold him down.\nI’m astonished. \nI can’t believe what I’ve done. I’ve never reacted this way in my life. This is the retrieval, I think to myself. My hands knew what to do. \nThey remembered.\nZu’s two friends look riveted. Everyone else in the lounge has stopped what they’re doing. They watch from their seats.\nLandon struggles on the tabletop. \nI tighten my hold to make him quiet. I don’t feel angry. Or any emotion at all.\nOnly clear and calm. \nReady to act.\nOne of Landon’s friends comes toward me. Hermes places a hand on his chest, stopping him.\nZu stares at me, over Landon’s slumped body. \"I think you better leave, Ori,\" she says. My strength empties out of me. Zu looks at me, as if I don’t matter. As if Landon doesn’t matter. As if nothing matters. She stares at me with a machine-like intensity.\nI glance at her bare wrists.\n\"Where’s the yarn?\" I demand.\n\"I lost it.\"\n\"What’s your problem?\"\n\"What’s yours?\" says Zu. \"We had a couple kisses. That doesn’t mean you own me.\"\n\"A couple kisses?\" I repeat, unbelieving.

I hear Landon whimper weakly. \"Was kissing me on the High Line a flaw? Was Central Park a flaw? Was Verona a flaw? Was dying for each other a flaw?\" \nIt comes out like a cannon.\nZu sits stone-like. I can feel she’s been reached. Even if she doesn’t show it. But the blankness remains.\n\"It was just a couple kisses,\" she repeats.\nThe fight drains out of me. \nI let go of Landon, who keeps his forehead low to the table anyway. I turn away from them, walking out of the lounge. \nHermes catches me, quickly.\n\"Ori!\" he grabs my arm. \nI shake him off."

But instead of Hermes’ presence inside of Tybalt, it’s Tybalt himself.\nThe difference is total.\nBetween a memory and war.\nThe brick studio collides with the sandy square in Verona, where I am facing Tybalt. Our fight to the death. Two battles, stretching over hundreds of years. The outcome in Verona is known. \nThis one is not. \nTybalt strikes with his rapier.\nHe attacks like a hurricane, making the retrieval with Hermes feel almost like a simulation.\nBut this is no simulation.\nIn the background, Mercutio lies dead.\nBeneath the Verona sun.\nI’m enraged.\nI meet Tybalt’s attack.\n\"I meant you no harm—\" I rage at Tybalt. \"I could have called you brother!\"\n\"In what life?\" Tybalt huffs.\n\"This one!\"\n\"Villain!\" says Tybalt, crazed.\nHe prepares a thundering blow, crashing his sword down upon me.\nI wield the black cudgel, blocking the blow.\nTai hammers me again. \nI defend and return his anger with the black cudgel. The lightweight weapon strikes his chest, knocking him backward.\n\"What happened to Zu?\" I demand again.\n\"She’s safe from you,\" Tybalt lashes.\nI attack, forcing him back.\n\"She doesn’t belong to you!\" I shout.\n\"Nor to you—\"\n\"She does,\" I say vengefully. \"You are merely a brother! I have married her.\"\nTybalt’s face writhes in pain.\n\"Liar of lies!\"\nHe charges madly.\n\"My lips are the proof,\" I shout at him. \"She has loved them more than yours.\"\nTybalt rages berserk.\nHe slashes at me with Adagio. \nIt’s pure rage. I duck and dodge, sewing machines and dress forms toppling in Tai’s wake. A wild blow strips the overhead lights from the ceiling. \nThey come crashing down. \n\"She’s forgotten about you,\" Tai sneers. \"As she should have, long ago!\" \nHearing this strikes my fears.\n\"Make her remember,\" I threaten. \n\"I can’t,\" says Tai. \nHe grins, darkly.\n\"It’s over.\"\nI batter Tybalt’s face.\nAll my rage overwhelms him. I bludgeon him with the hilt of Adagio.\n\"We were kin!\" I shout.\n\"Never, imposter.\"\n\"Have you no love?\" I spit.\n\"Love?\" Tybalt seems incredulous. \"Spoken from the thief of it!\"\n\"I’ve taken nothing.\"\n\"No, everything—\"\nTybalt’s eyes tear, through his blood.\nHe swings wildly at me. But his fury seems more sadness than anger.\nI strike back, throwing my shoulder into Tai. My fist crashes through his face. He collapses on the floor, laughing languidly. \n\"How?\" I demand.\nTai staggers to his feet. \nI beat him again with my hands. He slumps onto the frame of an open window. Adagio slips from his grasp, falling out the window.\nTybalt wriggles along the ground, defenseless. His sword lies in the distance.\nI advance on him with Adagio.\n\"There’s nothing you can do,\" I tell Tybalt. \"Juliet and I are joined.\"\n\"For hours,\" he scoffs.\n\"Lifetimes,\" I say.\n\"What is your week-old love—\" Tybalt crawls along the ground, \"compared to a brother’s? She was the one devotion in my miserable life.\"\n\"And death,\" I say.\nTybalt props himself up, his eyes dark. Behind us Mercutio lies on the ground.\n\"Romeo is not kind,\" he says.\n\"No,\" I say.\nI strike him down."

We exchange a reserved, awkward glance. \nLike with someone you used to know. \nIt hurts every time.\n\"I tried Shakespeare,\" says Hermes, \"Italian opera, we even stopped for espresso. Smelling salts! Anything to trigger her memory!\"\n\"I can’t smell a thing,\" says Zu. She relaxes in a swivel chair, one foot on the ground. \nI kneel in front of the chair. \n\"Zu, what can you remember?\" I say.\nShe eyes me suspiciously, like I’ve asked a trick question. I take a breath. \"What can you remember about us?\" \nI try to clarify. \n\"About our Verona life,\" I say.\n\"Our Verona life?\" Zu repeats, skeptically.\nOur connection is completely absent. \nWithout our bond, we’re just two people. Sure, we might even get along. But it wouldn’t matter. We don’t have a future without our past.\n\"Hermes—\" \nI turn, desperately.\nBut Hermes looks equally helpless.\n\"What happened in the Odyssey?\" I say.\n\"Plenty,\" he looks at me.\n\"Nepenthe,\" I say obviously. \"In the Odyssey. Did they ever remember their sorrow?\" \n\"It only lasted a day,\" Hermes answers, knowingly. \"But it was diluted in the wine.\"\nZu looks amused at our conversation. \nI turn toward her.\n\"Zu, we have a past together—\" I try explaining again, \"and a future.\"\nI look into her dark eyes.\n\"Don’t I feel familiar to you?\"\n\"Sure,\" she says, \"we met at Jack’s.\"\n\"And?\"\n\"And then I kissed you,\" Zu stifles a smile.\n\"And then?\" I’m hopeful. \nFinally I feel we’re getting somewhere. Zu pauses, thoughtfully. \"There was a car accident. I went to the hospital,\" she says, slowly. She sounds like she’s remembering an event from years ago.\n\"What about the ambulance?\" I ask urgently. \"Do you remember what happened in the ambulance?\"\nZu looks puzzled.\n\"Not really,\" she looks at me.\nZu sits there idly. She puckers her mouth and swivels around once in a slow circle. \nI’m losing patience.\nI feel my body stiffening from the fight with Tai. I’m reminded how Hermes helped me retrieve my Verona instincts. Could we do the same for Zu?\nCould we retrieve Zu’s past?\n\"Hermes, can you help?\"\n\"I’m trying, Ori.\"\n\"I mean retrieve her memory!\"\n\"I can’t do it.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Your connection is between the two of you,\" Hermes says simply.\nI turn around.\n\"Zu—\" I look in her eyes. \"Do you want to remember?\" She looks at me tentatively. \nZu meets my eyes. \n\"Sure,\" she says.\n\"You’re going to have to trust me,\" I say. \"Do you trust me?\" Again Zu looks carefully into my eyes. \n\"I do,\" she says cautiously. \nI’m remembering last night’s retrieval. How Hermes initiated it.\nBy connecting me to my anger.\n\"You need to think of something,\" I say, \"I mean feel something—that relates to your past,\" I tell Zu. \"Can you do that?\"\n\"I don’t know,\" Zu hesitates.\n\"What about Verona?\" I suggest. \"Can you feel anything about Verona? How you felt living there? How you felt in your parents’ house?\"\nZu’s eyes search. \"No.\"\n\"What about me?\" I say quickly. \"Meeting on your balcony—or when you woke up, in the tomb?\" \nZu makes a strange face.\n\"What am I doing wrong?\" I say.\nI turn to Hermes.\n\"Keep going,\" he says.\nI remember back to last night. I hear Hermes telling me to follow my feelings, like a magic thread, all the way into my past. \nOh, that’s my mistake! \nI’ve started at the wrong end. With things Zu no longer remembers. We need to start with what she does remember. \nWhat she does feel. \nIf anything.\n\"The car accident,\" I turn to Zu. \"What were you feeling before the accident?\"\nThis time I’ve connected. \nI see a flicker in Zu’s eyes, something in her gaze changing. Awakening. \"It was about you,\" her eyes narrow, remembering. \"And me.\"\nNow she’s feeling. I know she feels this.\nI can feel the retrieval beginning. The shape of the studio is beginning to shift. The brick walls are becoming transparent.\n\"What were you feeling?\" I continue.\n\"Love,\" she says, surprised.\nHer eyes deepen, glistening. The studio walls are quickly disappearing. Old Verona is taking shape around us. We’re outside a large stone house. A hint of stars appears above the translucent studio ceiling. \"I think—\" Zu struggles. \"I think we’re at my house.\" \nWe’re half in the studio, half in Verona.\n\"Someone’s coming,\" says Zu. \nI hear a woman’s voice: \"Juliet!\" \nThe stone house is taking form. Lush flowers weave along a trellis above our heads. \"My heart is beating,\" Zu says. \"I feel excited.\"\n\"What else do you feel?\"\nZu squints, as if her vision is blurry. \"I—\" she says, uncertainly, \"I don’t feel anything else.\"\nThe retrieval is beginning to reverse. \nAlarmingly, I watch the stone house and stars fading away. The solid, brick walls of the studio are returning. \"That’s okay,\" I say, trying to keep calm. \"Stay with it. What you were feeling about us?\" \nZu shakes her head.\n\"It’s gone,\" she says. The stone house is a rapidly retreating memory, beyond the studio walls. We’re quickly losing our link to Verona. \nI seize Zu’s hand in mine.\n\"Let me help,\" I say. \nZu grips my hand instinctively. I restart the retrieval, using my own feelings as the thread. The process feels easier, every time I engage it.\nLike a path I’ve walked before.\nImmediately, the studio walls soften. With our hands locked together, the stone house reappears once again. This time it’s more rapid, more visceral. I experience the sharp sounds, the sweet odors and colors of a party in Verona, five hundred years ago. The canopy of stars is brighter than any I remember. Only the faintest outline of the Gansevoort studio remains.\n\"Are you with me?\"\nZu nods.\nThe stone house is completely solid. We’re below the wooden trellis, overlooking the gardens. My heart is racing, someone is coming. My arms are covered in fine, 16th-century cloth. \nBut Zu looks the same. \nThe same as in New York City.\nShe wears the same black dress. The same dark eyeshadow. And the appearance of her skin, here in Verona, is transparent. She can’t enter into the past. She’s stuck in the present. \nI grip her hand tightly.\n\"Zu, you need to feel this,\" I say desperately. \"You need to feel what happened!\"\nEverything depends on this. \n\"I can’t.\" \n\"Try!\"\nZu holds my gaze and hand. \nBut I feel Nepenthe blocking her. Someone is approaching from the house, searching for us. I feel the rush of this moment, our first meeting. I try to pull Zu toward me, into the past, with my cloth-covered arms. But her hands are disappearing. \nI can no longer hold them.\nHer gaze drifts lower. \n\"I can’t feel it,\" she resigns.\nInstantly, the images of the stone house, the garden flowers, and the party begin packing up. The ceiling replaces the beautiful sky, and the brick walls block out the Verona night. Zu and I sit facing each other, in our street clothes.\nThe retrieval is over. \nIt failed.\nI sit back, shaken. Zu unclasps her hand from mine. I feel I’m sitting opposite a stranger. Zu gazes at me with as much feeling as a glass of water.\nI look ahead, stunned.\n\"I’m sorry,\" she says, apologizing for me. \"I know you wanted that to work.\" \nShe turns to Hermes.\n\"Can we go now?\"\nI’m shocked. We can’t end this way.\nNot after everything.\nNot like this.\nI get up, grabbing a vase of flowers. I toss out the flowers, throwing the water on Zu’s face.\n\"Ah, wha—?\" she sputters. \"Seriously?\"\nShe gasps in shocked surprise. \nZu lowers her head, breathing. Was a shock all she needed? Hermes and I lean forward, eagerly. \"Do you feel any differently?\" I ask.\n\"Yeah, I’m wet,\" Zu reacts angrily.\nShe grabs her backpack. \"Have a nice afternoon,\" she says, barely acknowledging me. She heads across the studio toward the door.\nI’m left with Hermes.\nSomething inside me snaps."

I start up the stairwell, pulling Zu behind me. \nShe’s shouting something.\nI don’t hear her words.\nWe ascend the stairs, crashing against the concrete walls. Zu pulls backward against me.\nBut I don’t stop.\nI throw open the door to the roof. The sunlight blazes into us. I step through the door.\nZu has a wild look in her eyes. I cross the bare rooftop, dragging Zu behind me. I feel enraged and crazed. Like there’s nothing left to do. Zu resists, beating at my arms and my chest, my head. \n\"Let go!\" she is yelling. \"Let go of me!\"\nI keep moving, forward.\nI sense what I’m about to do.\nBut it’s too terrible to say.\nWe cross the rooftop, battling.\nI head straight for the ledge. \"What are you going to do?\" Zu practically dares me. \"Throw us off?\"\n\"Why not?\" I shout back.\nThe ledge is twenty feet away.\nI drag us onward. \n\"Go ahead,\" Zu cries out. \"I can’t remember, okay? Whatever it is you want me to feel—I don’t feel it,\" Zu is nearly crying. \"So just do it!\" \nI shut my eyes, moving toward the ledge. \nI look straight down, to the black cars below. We’ve done this before. We died before, when there was no more hope. What’s so different now?\nWe can’t live like this.\nWe know how to do this.\nThe past repeats, said Lauren.\nI stand on the narrow raised ledge. Zu no longer resists me. She looks into the street. The roof drops three stories straight down. All we have to do is jump. \nI’m not afraid. \nWe’ve done this before. \nI hold Zu’s hand, tenderly. One more step is all we need. My weight would send us over. I’m picturing it happening. The two of us falling, hand in hand. I’m staring down into the street. The pavement feels so close. It would only take a second. \nThen we’d be together. \nAgain.\n\"I’m sorry,\" Zu is crying. \"I’m sorry, I can’t remember!\"\nWe can’t live like this.\nThe past repeats, said Lauren. \nI step gently forward, along the ledge. Toward the corner of the building. Zu steps backward, looking in my eyes the whole time. We’re nearing the corner. \nShe isn’t fighting anymore.\nZu nods her head slowly.\nWithout words.\nHer eyeshadow is smeared. Her eyes try to reach me, but behind some veil. Behind Nepenthe. I feel I’m watching someone underwater, sinking slowly out of sight. Her lips move, but no words come out. Every step quickens my resolve. The corner is ten feet away. \nI push us toward it.\nThe sunlight blinds our eyes. I hear horns from the street below. We’re in this together. I can see it behind Zu’s eyes. She can’t remember. \nBut somehow she agrees.\n\"Do it, Ori,\" she whispers.\nWe’ve reached the corner. I see the intersection below on both sides. \n\"Do it,\" she says.\nI don’t hesitate.\nI take another step, Zu steps backward.\nA cluster of pigeons bursts up above us. Zu swivels, avoiding the birds. \nHer foot misses the ledge. \nZu’s knee crashes upon the ledge. Her weight pulls me down, toward her. Toward the intersection below. I collide into Zu on the corner of the ledge. We’re smashed together at the edge of the building.\nIt’s our last chance.\nI kiss Zu, with everything I have.\nThe streets are still moving, below us. But we have stopped. Every hope and memory of the past and future is passing between our locked lips. The Capulet garden in Verona appears one last time. \nI am there with Zu. \nBut something has changed.\nZu is dressed in her black dress, but she’s no longer transparent. Her skin is the color of flesh.\nWe look on each other, like newborns. Our eyes have never known love before. In the warm floral night, we tremble in the garden. \nOne of us reaches out. \nIn Verona, I am kissing Zu.\nFor the first time. \nThe New York skyline is fading fast. Below the rooftops, the traffic starts and stops and starts again. Lights wink on across the city. \nIn the Capulet garden, something is happening. My hands hold firmly on Zu’s dress. But the fabric below my fingers is changing. It’s no longer modern, no longer black. I feel the softness of Juliet’s purple silk dress. Zu’s hands press warmly into mine. Our lips are sealed. \nThis is where we began.\nWe are, as we were.\nOn the Gansevoort rooftop, time passes. The moon arcs upward in the sky, a pale reflection on the river. I am kissing Zu on the rooftop.\nSomething is surfacing, inside her. \nI feel Zu’s fingers around my neck. Her body shakes, like she’s gasping for air. Like she’s rising from the dead. But Nepenthe won’t let go. I feel Zu being torn in two, between forgetfulness and memory. She’s somewhere between drowning and gasping for life. \nBetween a wail and roar.\nIn Verona, one whole second has passed. If time even passes at all. I am kissing Zu in the garden, in her purple silk dress. Back in New York City, the lights checker the night. The traffic races through the streets below, in trailing red and white lights. \nSlowly the lights come to a stop. \nOur kiss comes to an end. Beyond us is the green garden in the night, forever innocent. This moment, saved in the Verona stars. \nWe are, as we were."

My uncle was very proud of me.\nBut not always.\nOne particular night, we met together in the ornate perfume hall. I was to create my own fragrance, ideally resembling one of the Zhu masterpieces. My uncle and Li stood by, watching attentively.\nI began with ambergris and vanilla, and a bit of tonka bean to round it off. I saw their faces brighten, as they sniffed the preparation. \nI was doing as I had been taught.\nBut I had learned other things too.\nOn my own.\nI retrieved the trial perfume from Li. To this, I added a brush of starflower. I knew what this would do. I had noticed that certain fragrances could mask the powerful memory effects of perfume. \nI was excited by this.\nBut my instructor’s face went blank.\n\"No, Tai,\" said Li. \"We want to evoke memories, not make them go away.\" By his tone, I knew he meant the conversation was over. My uncle stared at me harshly, but did not speak.\nI debated my next move.\n\"But why?\"\n\"That is our way—\" my uncle interjected. \"For centuries, the Zhu perfumes have allowed people to remember what they have forgotten.\"\n\"Maybe,\" I protested, \"it’s time for a new way.\" \nMy uncle’s face turned granite.

I’m overcome by what I’ve seen. \"Everything that happened—in Verona—she’s responsible, she’s to blame!\"\n\"How?\" Zu demands.\nHermes steps toward me.\n\"Ori,\" he warns me.\n\"She was there—\" I ignore him. \"The idea for Mantua, the sleeping potion, the botched plan—\"\n\"Ori, stop—\" says Hermes.\n\"No.\"\nI stare at Zu.\n\"She needs to know what she’s done.\"\n\"Stop, Ori—\"\n\"She was there,\" I say. \"She was the priest!\"\n\"You’re breaking the Prime Law!\"\n\"I don’t care!\" I shout.\nLauren hasn’t moved.\nShe’s beyond pale, almost transparent. She doesn’t just seem devastated. She looks destroyed.\nBut I’m too angry to stop.\n\"We’ve been blaming ourselves,\" I say to Zu. \"For dying. But it wasn’t all our fault.\"\nZu looks deadly serious. She stands there, digesting what I’ve said.\n\"No one put a knife in my hands,\" she says sternly.\n\"But someone gave you a sleeping potion,\" I say, \"someone sent me away to Mantua, and someone forgot to tell me the plan! We trusted her, and she completely let us down!\"\nThe studio is absolutely silent.\n\"You ruin everything,\" I turn to Lauren \"You think you’re being helpful, but you’re not!\"\n\"Ori—\" Zu shouts. \"That’s enough!\"\n\"We don’t need you here!\" I shout at Lauren. I can’t control what I’m feeling. \nLauren is retreating, backing away from me. \nBacking toward the door.\n\"Go!\" I shout.\n\"Ori—\" Zu pulls me backward.\nLauren’s eyes are welling up. She moves shakily toward the studio door. I pursue her, then stop. The door bangs shut behind her."

I picture my drawing of the robed figure. The figure with their hands outstretched. Just like Lauren. \nNow it makes sense.\nI feel deeply silent, for what I now know. About someone I care about. About my teacher. The robed friar in Verona. Lauren.\nI lay my hand on Ori’s shoulder.\n\"It’s okay, Ori,\" I say.\nI sit down beside him.\nAfter a while, I say: \"Let’s take a walk.\"\nOri raises his head, his eyes unguarded. We stand up gradually. Ori follows me to the studio entrance. We start down the stairs, together.\nSlowly.\nWithout speaking.\nI can hear our footsteps, on the stairs.\nWe’re looking at each other.\nWith each step.\nI’m about to say something.\nTo ask how he’s feeling.\nBut it doesn’t feel right.\nNot yet.\nWe’re still in the starry dust.\nOri and I.\nSo instead.\nWe descend the stairs. \nTogether.\nEyes locked.\nGrowing closer again, with every step.\nJust our starry eyes and dust.\nThat immortal, starry dust. That was with us in Verona. That’s with us now. \nOri’s expression is changing.\nHis grief is falling away.\nStep by step. \nOri is coming back to me. \nWe round the landing of the second floor. A shadow of a smile escapes Ori’s lips.\nAnd mine.\nWe keep descending.\nSteadily.\nStep after step.\nEach step, like a tone.\nIn some timeless music.\nOrion smiles silently. The grief and sadness are letting go. We’ve turned the page.\nOur eyes and the starry dust.\nNow there’s no chance.\nOf speaking.\nThere’s so much more here.\nWithout words.\nOur eyes are speaking for us. Of centuries and places, of moments and magic.\nOf trials.\nAnd trust.\nStep by step.\nAs always.\nA woman is passing us, ascending the stairway. She glances at us, but our eyes don’t move.\nWe remain among the stardust.\nLike children.\nI am smiling so easily, now.\nAs is Ori.\nWe’ve reached the front entrance.\nI open it, without looking away. We squeeze through the doorway together.\nOutside the doors, the wrought iron buildings of Gansevoort Street frame the night. The streets and pedestrians go about their business. But somehow, quietly, existing in another world.\nOutside of us.\nOrion and I walk along the sidewalk.\nWe pass the restaurant, the evening diners at their tables. Toward the corner.\n\"Hey look—\" I point ahead.\nOri gazes forward.\n\"My shoe!\"\nI skip toward it, raising it triumphantly. Ori reaches me, eyes shining.\nI slip it on, excitedly.\nAcross the street is the High Line. Where this all began, a few mornings ago. We stand gazing upward.\n\"She cares about us,\" I say, \"so much.\"\n\"I know,\" Ori closes his eyes.\nWe stand there together.\n\"I just couldn’t believe it,\" Ori says. \"I just couldn’t believe it.\"\nI watch the moonlight shining down.\n\"Do you still wanna do it?\" I ask.\n\"The Lights?\" says Ori.\nI nod.\nOri looks in thought.\n\"Hermes calls it a timeline,\" he says.\nI look toward him.\n\"When there’s something you need to do,\" he says. \"To become who you are.\"\nI turn away, looking ahead.\n\"More than meeting again?\" I say.\nI feel the starry dust around us.\nOri doesn’t answer.\nQuietly I remember the Tavern, under the amber lights, talking to Orion there. What seems ages ago, but was only yesterday.\nI remember us both, like a dream:\nI have a story to tell, I say\nWhat’s it about?\nI think it’s our story\nYou can tell it at The Lights\nBut it’s already been told, I say\nNot to the end\nI don’t know what that means\nI’ll help you, he says\nI look at Ori now.\n\"It’s still scary,\" I say. \n\"Well,\" Ori is looking at me. \"What feels scarier? Doing it or not doing it?\"\n\"Doing it!\" I blurt out.\nWe both laugh.\n\"And what feels right?\"\n\"Doing it.\"\nI turn to Ori.\n\"Together,\" I add.\nOri smiles calmly.\n\"I think,\" he says, \"that was always the plan.\"\nThe starry dust shimmers.\nAnd I have the feeling:\nWhat we do at The Lights is as important as meeting each other. What we do together.\nSomehow.\n\"So, a timeline,\" I confirm.\nOri is silent.\n\"What’s at the end of it?\" I ask.\n\"We are.\"\nOri looks in my eyes. \"Hopefully.\"\nI feel like I’m seeing our future. The Lights, tomorrow and beyond. A series of days, each building upon the last. Building upon our past."

I don’t know what’s going to happen.\n\"You kissed Landon?\"\nI nod, carefully.\nOri draws his lips tight, as if deciding how to respond, then breaks into laughter. I watch Ori laughing. I’m not sure how to respond.\nI don’t know what this means.\nOri is laughing.\n\"I’m imagining him saying my lines,\" he says. I breathe, ever so quietly. \nI’m not sure why. \nBut I think I feel forgiven."

I flip up my hoodie, observing the sky without stopping. \nIt’s too late to stop. \nI’m learning destiny only has one direction.\nForward.\nThere’s a long, winding line outside the Capulet store, stretching around the block. I even spot a small tent. Is this the line for Nepenthe? \nI start to doubt myself. \nIf all these people want Nepenthe, who I am to say that’s wrong?\nBut I remember what happened. \nI think of the unfeeling blankness. The distance from Ori and from myself. The many destinies that may never happen. The many futures missed.\nIt makes me furious. \nThese people don’t know that. \nThey’ve only seen the Capulet’s clever marketing campaign. That Nepenthe is next to happiness. \nThat oblivion is bliss. \nI walk toward the glass door. \nStrips of black tape cover the crack left by my wine bottle. It’s hardly elegant, compared to the usual Capulet style. A cluster of girls about my age watch as I approach them. They’re the first in line. \nOne of them holds a furled umbrella.\n\"Hey—\" I say eagerly. \"Can I borrow that?\" \nBefore the girl can respond, I take the umbrella and smash the handle through the cracked glass. The pane splinters into tiny, fractured pieces. \nI hand the umbrella back to the girl. She nods approvingly.\n\"I don’t like lines either,\" she says.\nA well-dressed Capulet guard hurries toward me, as I step through the broken glass. He looks seriously tough. He’s about to speak up. \n\"Get Tai—\" I say.\nMy tone surprises him. \n\"Who are—\"\n\"You know who I am,\" I say. \nAmazingly he doesn’t challenge me. He turns and heads up the spiral staircase, while two other Capulets secure the broken glass door. They ignore me, while keeping the others outside. \nBut I’m the one who smashed the glass. \nThey don’t dare, I realize. The Capulets need me. That’s why they want me back. \nI have power here.\nI step forward into the showroom. The green, smart-looking vials of Nepenthe are laid out everywhere. On every table are tiny vials of Nepenthe. I bend over, peering into the deep green liquid.\nRemembering oblivion.\n\"Want to try it again?\" I hear. \nTai is descending the stairs, arrogant as usual. But something’s off. He seems to limp slightly. And there’s a bruise on his eye, which warms my heart. \nIt’s an unexpected gift.\nA reminder of Ori.\nEven battered, Tai has a powerful presence. For a moment, I question my decision to come. What difference can I possibly make? \nI tense up, automatically.\n\"No thanks,\" I answer. \"It worked perfectly.\" Tai draws closer to me, curiously. \"It seems like you remember,\" he observes.\n\"You need to stop Nepenthe,\" I tell him. \n\"Grow up, Zu,\" Tai gestures at the line outside. \"This is what people are waiting for.\" Beyond the glass walls, the dense clouds are growing darker. It’s exactly what I don’t want to see.\n\"I tried to warn you,\" Tai observes the storm. He steps away, turning up the stairs.\nI feel sick inside. \nI chase after him, into the perfume lab. \n\"You can still stop Nepenthe,\" I say, clinging to the reason I came here. My position feels hopeless. Tai doesn’t have to do anything I say. \nAnd my vision is coming true.\n\"You’re too late, Zu,\" Tai says, wearily. \"In an hour, Nepenthe will be on sale—in every Capulet store in the world.\"\n\"But it stops you from loving,\" I argue fiercely.\n\"That’s the point!\" Tai bellows. \nI’m astounded by his outburst. I didn’t think he’d be so obvious. He looks tired and overwhelmed with pain. I’m surprised by the compassion I feel.\n\"Tai,\" I say gently. \"Look at me.\" \nTai holds his eyes to the floor.\n\"There’s something you need to feel,\" I say. \nSlowly, angrily, Tai raises his eyes to mine. The hard contours of the room begin to change. The cold tones of the perfume lab are disintegrating. \n\"Stop this,\" Tai commands me. \n\"It’s not me,\" I say. \"It’s you. You’re beginning to feel. You’re retrieving your past.\"\n\"But I don’t want to.\" \nThe firm, square lines of the perfume lab are turning transparent. Our surroundings are changing. The bright Italian sun emerges through the dark New York clouds. What remains is Tai and me. \nOr rather, Tybalt and myself.\nTybalt appears solidly and fully physical. His hair is a magnificent, sandy brown, his clothes the finest of the day. His face is proud and fierce.\nI look down at my hands. \nThey are Capulet hands, golden tanned from the Italian sun. My shape—as Juliet Capulet—emerges from the transparent form of my New York body. I’m wearing my green lace dress. My hair is tied in beautiful braids. I step carefully forward.\nToward Tybalt.\nHe hides his gaze, avoiding me. We stand in the courtyard of the Capulet mansion. \n\"Tybalt—\" I approach him tenderly, \"I never meant to hurt you. I know I did.\" The Capulet lab has faded into the distant background, the glass skylight reduced to a translucent shadow.\nI’m moved, seeing Tybalt in the flesh. \nI feel my forgotten love for him. A sister’s love. \"I cared for you, when you were a baby,\" Tybalt says, clenching his fist. \"And then you left us.\" \n\"I know. I’m sorry,\" I say genuinely. \"It doesn’t mean I didn’t love you.\" Tybalt winces at my words.\nNow I understand. This is personal. \nThis isn’t really about Nepenthe. That’s not why I’m here. This is about Tybalt and me, about the pain and misunderstandings of our past. Now there’s a chance to change this. \nTo save Tybalt from his hate.\nThat’s the reason I’m here. \nAll I can do is tell the truth. \"Yes, I left you,\" I say. \"I left too soon. But it was out of love.\"\n\"Love,\" Tybalt snorts. \nBut I feel he wants to understand. To open to me.\n\"Yes, I was born a Capulet,\" I continue moving toward Tybalt. \"But I chose another way. I chose another life. But I chose it—it was my choice.\" I feel every word I am saying, observing how Tybalt responds. \"Now it’s your choice—to forgive me, or not.\n\"Forgive?\" says Tybalt, like it’s a foreign word.\n\"Yes, forgive,\" I say with all my heart. \"Forgive me for what I’ve done. That’s all you have to do. Please, please forgive me.\" I place my hand on his arm. Tybalt is trying to resist letting me in. \nBut he wants to. \nBecause I am Juliet, his sister.\nI am standing before him. I can smell the Verona earth and terra-cotta of the Capulet courtyard. I can see every wisp of Tybalt’s hair, in crystal clarity. There is so much beauty in him, beneath all of his hardened hate. Tybalt looks at me lovingly. \nThere is a gentleness in his gaze.\nI hold out my hand.\nHe reaches out, grasping it. His grip is tight, but underneath I feel him melting. \nI place my arm around his shoulder, as the sunlight shines on his cheek. The balconies of the Capulet mansion look down on us and the green gardens. Tybalt lowers his gaze slowly, his tension unwinding. \"How,\" he asks me, \"do you forgive?\"\nI’m not sure how to answer.\nI look down at the terra cotta. \"Maybe it’s about letting go,\" I say, \"even when you’ve been wronged.\" \nBut I’m not satisfied with my answer. \nA starling flies over our heads.\nI look up, watching it, and say the first thing that comes to mind. \"I lied to Orion—\" I explain, as an example. \"But he forgave me.\"\nTybalt freezes in my arms. \nOh—why did I mention Ori?\nAll his gentleness is gone. I feel his hard exterior reforming. How stupid could I be? Tybalt stands abruptly, backing away from me. \nI was only trying to share with him.\nHis eyes blaze a sad hate.\n\"No,\" says Tybalt. \"I don’t forgive you.\" \nHe is stepping backward, retreating into the shadow of the Capulet mansion. Already the Verona sun is disappearing behind the clouds. The stone mansion is crumbling, stone by stone. In its place, the glass Capulet lab returns like a prison. Above the skylight is the swirling, black storm.\nI’m still holding out my hand, stunned. \nTybalt retreats from me, returning to the grey shadow of Tai, in the Capulet lab. He stares hatefully into Tai’s face, then steps inside him.\nMy brother is gone. \nNow Tai is glaring at me. The glass Capulet lab is as sterile as ever. I’m no longer covered in beautiful lace, but back in my hoodie. \nThe retrieval is over.\nTai stares at me with demented hate.\nFor the first time, I feel in danger. \nThe black storm has arrived. Above the skylight, the clouds are dark with rain. I can’t tell if the darkness is the storm or the time of day.\nHow long have we been in retrieval?\nHave I missed The Lights?\n\"I’m sorry, Zu,\" Tai’s voice is hollow. \"This time, I can’t let you leave.\" The storm clouds are swirling violently above the skylight.\nI back out of the lab.\nDescending the stairs, I see a store filled with busy shoppers. Beyond the glass walls is the storm.\nI walk calmly toward the exit.\nTwo Capulet guards come for me. I quicken my step, but one of them grabs my arm. \nI can’t break free. \nThe glass doorway is just steps ahead.\nFrom my periphery, I see some shoppers around me, beginning to run. Suddenly the glass wall of the Capulet store shatters.\nGlass shards fly overhead.\nEveryone around me dives to the floor. \nI hear the crunching, cracking sound of a hundred things breaking. The Nepenthe tables are somersaulting through the air, sideswiped by a white car drifting across the showroom floor. \nI crouch down, shielding my face. The white car slides to a stop, as the passenger door opens. \n\"Come on, honey,\" I see Lauren’s face. \nThe Capulet guards are distracted just enough. I fling myself into her car."

It’s mid afternoon in New York, but it looks like night. \nThe black cars are right behind us.\nOne of them pulls alongside. \nI can see the Capulet driver, in his finely pressed shirt. Seeing him, I realize: the Capulets aren’t evil. They’re just stuck in the past. \nTrying to control others. \nThey haven't evolved past that stage. The Capulet driver veers his car directly into us, grinding the metal of our cars together. \nTrying to force us off the road.\nSo I don’t get to The Lights.\nSo I don’t make my appointment.\nSo I don’t escape them.\nHis car window rolls down. The driver strikes my window with a heavy baton, once and twice. But it doesn’t break the glass.\nLauren looks at me, impressed. \nThe next blow shatters glass all over me. The Capulet driver leaps into my window, his car veering astray without him, careening into parked cars. \nHe’s reaching for the steering wheel. \nI’m grappling with Capulet driver, as he dangles from the window. \nHis legs narrowly miss the passing cars. We swerve from one lane to another. Behind us, the second black car slams into us, trying to unbalance us. \nAhead the yellow light turns red. \nLauren accelerates through it. Cars from both directions scream by us. I grab the Capulet driver by the collar, with both my hands. Our eyes lock deeply, inches apart. Something is happening.\nHis face begins to change. \nI’m seeing one face after another, layered over his physical features. A teenage boy, then a beautiful young girl, then an older woman gaze back at me.\nIt’s a multi-life time crossing.\nSomehow I’ve triggered it. \nA half dozen of the Capulet driver’s past lives appear before me. Each one is searching me. \nEye to eye. \nI’ve never experienced anything like this. I didn’t even know it was possible. I am seeing thousands of years of their past. What I’m seeing is the real Capulet driver. Who doesn’t want to hurt me. Who’s only joined the Capulets in this life, anyway. \nWho doesn’t care about this chase.\nWe are connecting, human to human. We speed onward for a block, like this. \nEye to eye.\nThe Capulet driver has stopped fighting. He’s too immersed in what he’s seeing about his past. He holds my gaze, intently. \nThen he simply lets go. \nHis body drops away from Lauren’s car. I look back, watching him rolling over the pavement. \nBeside me, Lauren meets my gaze. She’s seen what just happened. The other Capulet car and motorcycle are swerving behind us, darting through traffic.\nAll three vehicles race onward.\nUnder the darkening storm."

It stands atop a bright red square on the tabletop. On the side of the vial is a digital reading. \nIt reads: 10%\nI move my finger upward along the vial, sliding the reading to 100%. \"Tai, this potency will allow you to remember all your past lives,\" RITA announces. \n\"I know.\"\n\"I can’t allow it,\" RITA is silent a moment. \"You won’t be able to handle the integration.

I pour a single red drop on the ceramic altar.\nThe drop splashes up on impact. \nThe invisible molecules exploding into the air.\nIn a half second, my view of reality is shattered. It’s like an incredible medicine, working its way through my body. I collapse forward onto the altar, my mouth locked in a silent gasp. I feel I’m being torn apart. I’ve never experienced anything like this. It’s the pain, pleasure and exhilaration, fear and joy, hope and humiliation of every emotion I’ve ever had, multiplied a thousand times. A tidal wave of emotions is crashing down on me. \nI know I won’t survive this.\nMy eyes are tightly shut. But my inner eye is flooded with images, one after another: a beautiful village, clouds and clouds, celebrations, faces and faces and laughter, a raging river, a baby’s cry, children, the sun and moon in the sky, a battlefield and armies clashing, a strand of hair upon a cheek, a canoe in the moonlight, letters and handwriting. Each image is also an emotion, a sense of myself. It is a full and complete picture of all my past. I am bombarded with emotions, images, each lasting split seconds, merging and overlapping into each other. \nIt’s a matter of seconds in the real world. \nBut millennia inside of me. \nI collapse to the base of the altar, my arms and legs sprawled awkwardly. Above the skylight, the black storm rains down heavily. \nI appear unconscious.\nInside me, the centuries unravel. Like a film rewinding faster and faster, from two to five to five hundred images a second. I can’t keep up with my memories. I feel myself splitting into hundreds of parts. \nThis will be the end of me.\nI feel myself approaching my limit. \nOn the one side is everything I know of myself. On the other, infinity and annihilation. I feel myself riding the edge of my limits, learning to navigate thousands of years of memories. The images go on and on.\nThen slowly stop. \nOn one single scene.\nIt’s a lush green countryside. The misty morning and fields are as vibrant as they could only be in the distant past, a thousand years ago. \nBefore I was Tybalt, before Verona. \nThere’s no longer any place on earth like this. No countryside so untouched and dense. I’m enlivened by the green air upon my skin.\nA small farm rests on the edge of the forest. \nI live there. I’m a simple man, compared to my present life. I live in a small, wooden house. It’s dark inside, with few windows, but at the right time of the day, near dusk, the sunlight aligns and shines through the door. I tend the small farm by myself. I harvest two fields and raise a few pigs. It isn’t much, but I look after it carefully, keeping busy from morning to night. I’m a hardy man, who understands the land. \nMy life revolves around my labor.\nThe images linger on the farm and the woods. Then a young woman’s face appears, radiant as the sun. A face of honest, simple beauty. \nThis woman has entered my life.\nBefore this moment, I lived only for my work. I had never expected to meet anyone. But now I have met this beautiful woman. We are talking outdoors, the midday sun above us—we are smiling. I am smitten. I love this woman, and she loves me. We are dancing together at the village festival. Everyone is dancing. I feel I am the luckiest man in the world. For the first time in my life, I feel true happiness. The young woman is simple and straightforward, the daughter of someone in the village. She loves me for who I am, for my work ethic and for my honesty. \nI never tell a lie. It is against my principles.\nWe are married outdoors, in a green field. She is wearing white. Her family is there. I am humbled and reserved as always, but inside I am overjoyed. I take her hand before the priest. My wife places a silver chain in my right hand, attached to a rose petal pendant. The priest is pleased. Not all couples are so happy. \nMy wife and I kiss.\nTogether we live on the small farm. Her presence brings joy to the wooden house. The air feels lighter and every room of the house is happy. I have found a new life. My wife assists me with the farm, even with the pigs. I no longer work alone. My solitary life is over. I never expected this, never even hoped for this. \nBut this is my life now. \nTwo, three seasons pass. \nMy wife is giving birth. It’s midnight in the bedroom of the small house. The early winter snow covers the ground. The midwife is there, and my wife is having our baby by candlelight. I sit anxiously in the bedroom. I feel everything in my life depends on what is happening now. Finally in the early hours, my wife gives birth. Our daughter is born. I hold her, my eyes wet.\nNow it’s the New Year. It’s cold and the snow is falling heavily. My wife lies ill in bed, while I labor outside. I am cutting wood for our fire. My wife looks pale beneath the covers. She is propped against the pillows, holding our baby. I feed her soup from a wooden spoon, sitting beside the bed. My wife sips the soup weakly. \nI watch them, worried.\nOutside, the snow keeps falling.\nThe scene shifts to the winter woods. A view of treetops and white sky are visible through bare branches. Below, a black-clothed priest is saying something. He makes a gesture with his hands. My wife and baby are being lowered into the ground. Two men shovel dirt into the ditch. I stand alone beside the hole. The priest is speaking, but I don’t hear him. The snow is falling on the ground. The priest is walking away. I am left alone in the forest.\nThe last thing I see is the wooden house.\nIt’s barren and empty. For miles, there is nothing but winter. I live alone with my memories. Sometimes the pain in my heart is so much I collapse onto the earthen floor, crying until I fall asleep.\nI feel this pain in my heart. \nI see images of my wife while she was alive: smiling, radiant as the day, laughing and kissing me. Images of the empty house.\nI see myself alone, on a country road at dusk. I carry a small pack, walking away from the house. In my right hand, I hold the silver chain with the rose pendant, my wife’s gift from our wedding day. It dangles between my fingers. I am clenching the links of the chain as tightly as I can, rubbing them between the fingers of my fist. \nAgain and again, I clench the rose pendant within my closed fist. This clenching is all I can feel.\nI take a vow:\nI will never love anyone again. \nI hear myself speaking: I promise, for ever and ever, I will never love again. Oh God, if only you take this pain from me, I will never love again.\nI will never love again. I promise.\nI promise.\nSomething snaps across time. I feel my eyelids flutter. In my heart is the pain from the winter farm, but my eyes see the floor of the Capulet lab. I feel both experiences at once. My first thought: I’m alive.\nMy second: I remember.\nI remain motionless, staring sideways across the cold white floor. I feel the memories of my past as a symphony inside of me. Every memory is a note, with its own time and place in the larger whole. I no longer feel pain. Only understanding, for who I am. \nI know what I have to do:\nI have to save Orion.\nNo one else can save him. His fate has already been decided, but maybe I can change it. Zu made her choice. She loves Orion and so be it. It was only my hardened heart that tried to prevent this. How long I’ve lived with this hardened heart! \nMy entire life and my Verona life too. The battles with Orion and the Montagues—all because of this pain in my heart. It was too much to feel, so I closed myself off. I became a stranger to love.\nI even forgot why. \nMy beautiful wife, who died. \nNow I remember. In my pain, I had forgotten even you. But now I remember. Now I remember you.\nI experience all this instantly. \nThen in the next instant: \nForgetting is wrong. Nepenthe is wrong.\nI made forgetting my life’s work. I built a shrine to forgetting, because I felt too much pain to remember. I wanted the world to forget. \nLike I did.\nBut it’s wrong, it’s wrong.\nI start to cry. \nI lie sideways, a cold tear falling from my eye onto the floor. Above, the rain cascades on the skylight.\nI begin to move. I flounder at first, as if learning to use my limbs again. But then my muscles remember. I make it onto my knees, then stand gingerly beside the white ceramic table. How much time has passed? Have I been here for hours? An entire day? I’ve lived through lifetimes.\nBut how long has passed in the real world?\nI look down at the ceramic block. In the center is a digital console, displaying minutes and seconds. I stare, as it passes 9:59 and hits 10:00.\nTen minutes!\nLifetimes in ten minutes.\n\"Welcome back,\" I hear a voice, then remember who is speaking. \"I’m glad you made it,\" RITA says.\nI don’t have time to chat.\n\"Access the Nepenthe formula.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"I need to make a change.\"\n\"But why?\" RITA repeats.\n\"Nepenthe is flawed,\" I explain. I am quickly regaining my clarity.\n\"You are incorrect, Tai,\" RITA says. \"Nepenthe is perfect.\"\n\"Access the base formula, RITA.\"\n\"I cannot.\"\n\"Why?\" I am stunned.\nI feel a pang of fear. I calm myself, knowing RITA will detect my voice tones.\n\"You yourself programmed me, Tai, to block access to the base formula,\" says RITA, pausing, \"unless there was good cause. So I need to understand why.\"\n\"I don’t have time—\"\n\"Then be quick,\" says RITA.\nI grip the table, grinding my teeth.\n\"Nepenthe has a flaw—\"\n\"That’s not true, Tai,\" RITA interrupts me. \"Nepenthe is perfect. We created it together.\"\n\"Yes. It’s perfect in what it does,\" I explain, hastily. \"But it’s what it does that’s imperfect. Humans are meant to remember. Not forget.\"\n\"You told me humans want to forget.\"\n\"I was wrong. We want to forget—only because we are afraid.\"\n\"Afraid of what?\"\n\"Afraid of feeling.\"\nRITA does not respond.\n\"We aren’t machines, like you,\" I argue. \"We feel incredible, overwhelming, heartbreaking feelings.\"\n\"Is that a flaw?\" RITA asks.\n\"No—\" I say. \"It’s—a gift. But the flaw is that when the feelings are too overwhelming—too overpowering—we shut down. That’s our flaw. We close down to who we truly are. We live in small, safe sectors.\"\nRITA is thinking.\n\"Humans are more than they appear,\" says RITA.\n\"Yes! Yes!\" I exclaim.\nI stand there anxiously, waiting. RITA is silent again. I wonder what is going on inside her mind. I can almost feel her learning.\n\"The base formula is unlocked,\" RITA says.\nI feel an elation I’ve never experienced. Yes—yes, yes! Now nothing stands in my way.\n\"Display it,\" I command.\nA holographic representation of Nepenthe’s base formula appears above the ceramic altar. It rotates slowly, while I observe it. It’s so beautiful, I think. The work of so many years and so much effort, all for the purpose of forgetting who we are. \nWhat a titanic waste.\nI am looking, looking, looking. My eyes scan dozens of chemical compounds in microseconds, searching for the crucial link.\nWhere? What do I change? \n\"Can we just delete it?\" asks RITA. \n\"No, too obvious,\" I reply. I look up and down at the holographic formula. \"How much has Nepenthe already been used?\" I ask.\n\"Nepenthe has been used 13,236,928 times,\" RITA replies. \"Unfortunately, our update will not affect these users.\" \nI cringe. \nI feel the weight of the all those destinies. All those lives sent astray.\n\"Life is imperfect,\" RITA says.\nFrantically I search the dozens of ingredients. Where is the crucial compound? I’m reminded of Nepenthe’s amazing simplicity. It’s not a complex mash of hundreds of chemical compounds. Rather the opposite. Its perfection is its simplicity. Then I see it. There.\nEssence of apple. \nOf course.\nIt’s barely noticeable in the perfume at all. But it influences all the other relationships. I joined essence of apple together with starflower in a recipe of forgetting. \"Change apple to—\" I consider for a pensive moment, then smile broadly. \n\"Change apple to rose.\"\nIt’s perfect. Even in hacking my own perfume, I can appreciate the artistry of my work. \"An elegant choice, Tai,\" says RITA.\n\"However,\" says RITA, \"I’m afraid you aren’t authorized to make changes to base formula.\"\nWhat! \n\"But—you said,\" I stammer.\n\"No one person has authorization.\"\nI feel a staggering weight of despair. It’s like being buried under an avalanche, one step from victory. My monster will win after all.\n\"But I do,\" says RITA. \"Base formula is updated. All logs have been erased.\" The crucial molecular link glows bright blue, then slowly fades. \nIt’s done. \nI stand alone at the table, my legs trembling. I place my palms on the ceramic altar, bow my head deeply and remember all the people I have ever cared for, ever loved. Multitudes of people over lifetimes, friends, chance encounters, Zu of course—and above all, my wife in the winter house, so long ago.\nI love you still.\nThere is one thing left to do.\nI have to change Ori’s future. But how? I don’t even know if it’s possible. But I have to try. I gaze into RITA’s ruby image.\nI feel like a child again.\n\"Thank you, RITA.\"\nI turn quickly from the altar. The black clouds and rain rage above the skylight. I exit the lab, hearing RITA behind me, one last time.\n\"Goodbye, Tai.\""

      "text": "There’s a knock at my door. \nI walk across the studio, open it. \nZu gives me a look. \n\"Ready?\" she says. \nI grab my bag, we head down the stairs together. Outside on Gansevoort we look across to the High Line, watching the traffic move up and down the street.  \nZu smiles, as I tap my phone.\nI enter a location.\nThe ride choices appear. I glance at them, and without hesitating, I choose Share. \nWithin a minute our Uber arrives. Zu and I recline in the backseat, closely together. She’s wearing a white printed t-shirt and black jeans, and I’ve borrowed one of Hermes’ jersey pullovers. We’re watching New York City outside the windows. \nI tap a notification on my screen, as Zu leans into me.\nA news video begins playing: \"In fashion news, Nepenthe, the latest fragrance from the House of Capulet, has become the biggest hit in the company’s storied history. But the so-called \"feel-good fragrance\" isn’t quite what people expected. Billed as the end of suffering, customers say Nepenthe is more like a leisurely walk in the park.\" \n\"But it’s the bottom line that matters. The House of Capulet appears stronger than ever.\" \n\"In a related story, memorials are being held for Tai Fang, creative director of the House of Capulet. As you know, Tai Fang was killed backstage at the Trinity Lights benefit this weekend. Details are still murky, but his creative heir Lucrezia de Rosa has been taken into custody. The question on everyone’s mind now: Who will lead the company?\"\nI move to switch it off, but Zu grabs my hand.\n\"On another note,\" the announcer continues, \"a performance at the same Trinity Lights event has gone viral. A re-make of Romeo and Juliet by two Trinity Rose high-schoolers has hit 100 million views across social media platforms.\" The video cuts to a short snippet of Zu, bent over my body on the stage. \"Viewers say the students captured the timeless magic of the famous lovers in a deeply moving way.\" \nWe watch a reporter talking. \n\"The performance has even sparked an urban myth,\" she looks into the camera, \"that Nepenthe stops working once you watch the video.\" The screen shows a social media post: \"Y’all Nepenthe was fine, til I watched this video 😭😭😂 #feelit\"\nI swipe off the app.  \nI put my phone away and we’re both silent. Zu looks at me and I look at her. \nWe have no words. \n\"How are you doing?\" I ask. \nZu looks out the window, then at me. \n\"I’m good,\" she nods, then smiles. \nWe pass an intersection, where our Uber pulls toward the curb. A woman in a white jacket joins our ride, climbing into the front passenger seat. She has a striking presence. For a block or so, Zu and I observe her from behind.  \nThe woman turns around casually.  \n\"I saw your performance,\" she says, with clear, piercing eyes. \"It really spoke to my heart.\" \n\"Oh,\" says Zu, surprised, \"thanks.\" \nI am captivated by her presence. Her eyes seem to radiate with clarity and purpose. \"I was looking around the audience,\" the woman in white looks at Zu. \"I think you touched some people.\" \n\"I wanted to,\" Zu says, honestly. \n\"Well, consider me a fan,\" the woman smiles. She hands us a white card, which Zu takes. \"My name is Santiaga. Look me up, if I can ever be of service.\" \nShe gives us a friendly glance. Our Uber pulls toward the sidewalk again, and Santiaga quickly steps out.  \nWe’ve hardly traveled five blocks together.  \n\"Didn’t have far to go,\" she winks at us, before literally disappearing in the busy New York street. \nI look back out the window as we accelerate, sensing something important has happened.  \nBut what? \n\"There’s no writing,\" Zu says. \nShe flips over the card.  \nOn the back side is an embossed white tree. \nZu moves her thumb over the texture. \n\"That’s pretty,\" she turns to me. \nI look down at the tree. \nWe’ve arrived at Trinity Rose. \nI look out at the school, feeling weird butterflies in my stomach. \"I hate Mondays,\" I sigh. Zu gives my hand a squeeze, then turns up her lip.\n\"A deal is a deal,\" she says. \nWe get out together, on the same side, then head toward the school. I see Hermes and Kimmo, standing by the entrance. Some of the other kids are starting to notice us. They are gathering around.\nWe go toward them."
