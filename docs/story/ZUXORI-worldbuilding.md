### Fragrance & Memory 🌿🕰️
With a profound link to memory—a single fragrance can transport someone to a long-forgotten moment, rekindle an emotion, or awaken something buried deep inside. The House of Capulet, with centuries of mastery in perfumery, has refined this relationship between fragrance and memory into an artform. Their lineage traces back to Renaissance Verona, where they first crafted perfumes infused with botanicals and rare extracts to evoke emotions, enhance recall, and stir desire. Over the centuries, their expertise evolved—blending ancient alchemy with modern neuroscience—to create scents that do more than evoke memories; they alter them.

**Capulet perfumes include:**

- Nepenthe (Green) – Erases past-life memories, manipulating destiny by controlling who remembers and who forgets.
