# HERMES

Hermes is both a guide and Initiate, a force of brilliance, vision, and prophecy woven into the modern world. He carries echoes of the recklessness of Mercutio and the rebelliousness of Delphine—wrapped within the calm wisdom of his Montague Initiation. Always a step ahead, he is often portrayed with his holograms (often in his palm), skateboard, and laptop.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Bright, Keen Eyes** - Always watching, always calculating. There’s a glint in his gaze that suggests he knows more than he lets on.
- **Full, Thick Hair** - Untamed and lively, much like his mind. It’s as if his thoughts move so fast that his body struggles to keep up.
- **Always In Motion** - He never lingers too long in one place, always shifting, restless. His body language is fluid, almost feline.
- **The Riddler’s Tongue** - Hermes speaks in layers, in riddles, in half-truths that always contain whole meanings.
- **A Signature Smirk** - Hermes is rarely without a knowing, playful smirk, as if he’s just waiting for the world to catch up to him.

## Symbolic Items
- **Holograms** - His signature tech—fleeting, brilliant, and often shaped like butterflies.
- **Laptop** - His primary weapon in the digital age. 
- **Skateboard** - His constant companion, a symbol of movement and rebellion.
- **Fencing Sword / Broomstick** - Fencing team captain, with or without a sword.
- **Wright Institute Patch** - Quiet mark of his legacy, not always front-and-center.
- **Snacks / Chips** - Fuel for genius—plus, he just really likes chips.

## Key Lines
- **"Answer my riddle."**   
- **"I cracked the code."** 
- **"Destiny doesn't wait."** 
- **"It’s all part of the training."**
- **"Where do you need to go to find fortune, fate and truth?"** 
- **"Stop holding back!"**
- **"The Montagues and Capulets are a small act in a much larger play."**
- **"Love can change the world."** 

## Emotional & Mystical Representation
- **The Montague Initiate** - Unlike Ori and Zu, Hermes remembers. His past is not a mystery, but a window. He carries the wisdom of past lives and the duty to guide others—but also the weight of knowing what happens when things go wrong.
- **Heir To Tech Fortune** - Son of a powerful innovator, Hermes could inherit an empire—but he’d rather hack its systems than sit on its throne.
- **Santiaga's Student** - She saw something in him no one else did. Their connection endures, beyond lives and time.

Hermes is Mercutio reborn, but wiser, sharper, and far more effective. He is the one who sees everything—the past, the present, and the countless possibilities of the future. He is a guide, the one who will push Ori and Zu toward their destiny—but not without having some fun.
