# LAUREN

Lauren is a quiet guardian of fate, a woman whose heart carries both wisdom and regret. As the reincarnation of Friar Laurence, she is the one who once tried to help Romeo and Juliet escape their tragic destiny—and failed. In this life, she is not a priest, but a teacher, still drawn to storytelling, to guiding lost souls, and, unknowingly, to atoning for the past.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Soft but Intent Eyes** – There’s a depth to her gaze, like she’s always thinking two steps ahead, always weighing what she should say and what she should leave unsaid.
- **Long, Dark Hair** – Often worn loose or in an easy bun, a sign of someone too focused on thoughts to worry about appearances.
- **Simple, Earth-Toned Clothing** – No flash, no pretense—just comfortable, natural, grounded. She is someone who wants to be approachable, safe, but there is an elegance in her simplicity.
- **The Scent of Warm, Earthy Rose** – Her presence is calming, like a late-summer evening, like something both old and enduring.

## Symbolic Items
- **Books / Study** – The overflowing bookshelves of her study are her sanctuary.
- **Theater Masks (Comedy & Tragedy)** – A nod to Lauren's role as a theater teacher.
- **Hands Outstretched** - A gesture passed down from Lauren’s past life as Friar Lawrence.
- **Glasses** - An occasional accessory when Lauren is in teacher mode.
- **Tea / Tea Cups** - Lauren's comfy drink, especially in her study.
- **Pink Cowboy Hat** - A surprise in Lauren’s wardrobe, worn in Central Park.
- **Lorenzo** - Lauren’s loyal dog, often by her side.

## Key Lines
- **"Your story will find you."**
- **"Are you saying Shakespeare is wrong?"**
- **"According to tradition—there are laws of reincarnation."**
- **"So you actually remember your past?"**
- **"Animals are people too."**
- **"I ruined everything for them."**

## Emotional & Mystical Representation
- **The Guilt of a Past Life** – She doesn’t remember Verona—yet. But somewhere inside her, there is a shadow of regret, a feeling that she failed two lovers who trusted her. That feeling drives her to protect Zu and Ori—even when she doesn’t know why.
- **The Teacher, The Guide, The Anchor** – Lauren is not just an advisor to Zu—she is Zu’s touchstone, her safe place, the one person Zu can confide in when reality starts unraveling.
- **A Skeptic and a Believer** – She believes in stories, in history, in the human need for meaning. But she does not believe in fate. Not yet.
- **The Quiet Force of Destiny** – While others get caught up in their emotions, Lauren watches, thinks, guides. But will she step in when it matters most? Or will she, once again, be too late?

Lauren is Friar Laurence reborn, but this time, she is not just a bystander to fate. She has a chance to change things—to finally save Romeo and Juliet.
