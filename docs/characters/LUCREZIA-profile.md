# LUCREZIA

Lucrezia is a modern alchemist, wrapped in silk and science, memory and mystery. As a brilliant perfumer for the House of Capulet, she lives between centuries—part present-day innovator, part shadow of an ancient past. Though she wears a lab coat, it’s her intuition and yearning that guide her deepest work. And beneath her poised intellect lies a secret ache: the memory of a father she never knew, and a friendship she may have once shared with Juliet herself.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Platinum Hair** – Pale and sharp, a crown of contrast against the deep reds and glassy whites of her lab surroundings. Her hair evokes both futuristic clarity and Renaissance pallor.
- **Almond Eyes** – Soft but observant, constantly analyzing, searching for truths no microscope can reveal.
- **Elegant, Minimal Style** – Whether in her lab coat or traveling attire, Lucrezia blends precision with grace. She always seems a step removed from the world, like someone who dreams in data and memories.

## Symbolic Items
- **Glass Vials & Fragrance Strips** – Her tools of memory research.
- **The Blue Perfume (Orpheus)** – A fragrance that reveals the future—Lucrezia’s "crystal ball."
- **The Red Perfume (M)** – The unfinished memory formula, Lucrezia's goal.
- **Memory Shapes** - Hidden truths received from her father—not in words, but in mental shapes.
- **Single Earring / Stud**: A subtle personal detail—asymmetrical, like her perspective.
- **Silk Scarf** - Worn in her hair outside the lab—soft, personal, and timeless.
- **White Lab Coat** - Standard issue, quietly refined to fit her rhythm.
- **Lab Goggles** - Part of Lucrezia’s everyday gear in the perfume lab.

## Key Lines
- **"We could change lives. Including our own."**  
- **"Every hour, the future becomes more fixed."**
- **"Everything has a smell. Wood, concrete, metal, even glass."**
- **"It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backward."** 

## Emotional & Mystical Representation
- **The Seeker of the Past** – Lucrezia is haunted by the missing presence of her father, driving her obsession with past-life memory. Her motives are not domination, but restoration—of connection, of story, of self.
- **The Capulet with a Conscience** – Though loyal to Tai, she often questions the morality of Nepenthe. Her heart whispers that forgetting may be worse than pain.
- **The Friend Remembered** – There are flashes, hints, an unnamed kinship when she sees Zu. Perhaps in Verona, they were friends—maidens of scent, secrets, and starlight.
- **The Mirror of Juliet** – Not a rival, but a reflected self—what Juliet might have become had she stayed, had she chosen legacy over love.

Lucrezia is not villain, not saint—but a crossroads, where past and future meet in vapor and longing. She is the question that lingers after the perfume fades: What is the cost of memory—and what is its worth?
