# TAI

Tai is a storm contained in human form, a force of passion, resentment, and fate wound so tightly that even he doesn’t know whether he’s about to explode or implode. As the reincarnation of Tybalt Capulet, he carries the weight of unfinished vengeance and unspoken grief. He is often portrayed with a black designer shirt, a white Capulet mask, Nepenthe, and the quiet presence of cats.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Sharp, Angular Features** – Everything about Tai is precision—his cheekbones, his jawline, even the way he moves is deliberate, as if sculpted by tension itself.
- **Dark, Piercing Eyes**– His gaze is intense, almost unbearable. Looking into his eyes is like staring into a blade—there is beauty, but also the promise of something lethal.
- **Always Dressed in Black** – A uniform of control, of mourning, of power. His clothing is immaculate, expensive, tailored to perfection, because Tai does not allow for imperfections—not in himself, not in others.
- **A Controlled Stance** – He rarely makes unnecessary movements, every gesture calculated. But when he does move—it’s with purpose, with force, with the kind of energy that cannot be stopped.

## Symbolic Items
- **Nepenthe (The green vial)** – The memory-erasing perfume—Tai's creation and weapon.
- **Oversized Designer Shirt (Black)** - His signature look—tech visionary meets old-world heir.
- **Sharp, Edgy Hairstyle** - A modern cut with a sharp fade.
- **Capulet Mask** - A dream-symbol of Tai's embodiment of the Capulet legacy.
- **Capulet Dagger** – The symbol of the House, still used in the Capulet brand. 
- **Black Cudgel** - Tai’s mysterious weapon in his fight with Ori.
- **RITA** - Tai's mirror—precise, calculated, and a creative partner.
- **Cats** - A nod to Tybalt, the "Prince of Cats."

## Key Lines
- **"Hello Juliet."**
- **"Pain is a disease."**
- **"Welcome to a new world."**
- **"Goodbye sorrow—hello happiness."**
- **"Melancholics are the masters of memory."**
- **"You and Romeo killed yourselves for nothing."**
- **"Everyone is reincarnated."**
- **"I will never love again. I promise."**
- **"Change apple to rose."**
- **"Forgive me for what I’ve done."**

## Emotional & Mystical Representation
- **The Wounded Prince** – Tai remembers, even if he’d rather not. Forced by his uncle to remember Verona, he can’t escape its grasp. And that is both his power and his curse.
- **A Sibling’s Grief** – He was Juliet’s brother in Verona. He loved her—but she chose Romeo. And in that choice, he lost everything. His hate for Ori is not just personal—it is existential.
- **The Creator of Forgetting** – Tai is obsessed with control, with order, with the idea that he can erase the chaos of destiny. If no one remembers their past, then no one has to suffer it.

Tai is Tybalt reborn—sharp, composed, and rageful. He’s no longer just a fighter, but a thinker, crafting perfumes that alter memory and steer fate. He believes in control, in keeping pain at a distance. But beneath the surface, there’s still a brother who lost everything, who will do anything to make it right.
