# ORI

Ori is a figure caught between worlds. As the reincarnation of Romeo Montague, he carries the weight of a love that transcends time. His presence is magnetic, enigmatic, and quietly powerful. He is often portrayed with the sword Adagio, headphones and spray paint, and occasionally a red sun background.

## Physical Characteristics

- **Tall & Lightly Built** - Strong but lean, his physicality reflects a quiet confidence, a strength that is more internal than external.
- **Messy, Wavy Hair** - Always a little tousled, as if he’s too lost in thought to care. It’s both effortless and deliberate, adding to his air of mystery.
- **Sharp, Clear Eyes** - Deep and contemplative, his gaze holds an intensity that can feel like a quiet storm. His eyes betray his emotions even when his words do not.
- **Blue Hoodie** – His favorite throw-on, a subtle shield against the world. It gives him a sense of anonymity, but also a connection to something deeper within himself.

## Symbolic Items
- **Headphones / Spray Paint** - His escape and expression—music in his ears, art in his hands.
- **Plastic Necklace** - Ordinary, worn daily—his quiet anchor to the present.
- **The White Dress** - A creation tied to Juliet’s memory (her wedding dress).
- **Adagio (Sword)** - His past-life weapon. Shattered battling Tai, marking a break with fate.
- **The Red Yarn Bracelet** - A gift to Zu, originally Ori's.
-  **The Red Sun** - A moment of destiny in the desert outside Los Angeles.
- **Red Scooter** - Ori's signature ride, a Vespa.

## Key Lines
- **"Wonder is a virtue."** 
- **"I've always felt I had a secret."** 
- **"What’s more important than love?"** 
- **"I hate Mondays."**
- **"I’m right where I belong.”**
- **"Oh no, oysters.”**
- **"We’re all different. But we’re also the same."**
- **"Every future has a past."**
  
## Emotional & Mystical Representation
- **A Rebel’s Heart** - He doesn’t follow rules, not out of defiance, but because he sees the world differently. This is reflected in his artistic style—his designs break convention, just as his soul refuses to conform to expectations.
- **The Gaze of Recognition** - When he meets Zu’s eyes, everything else disappears. He is the one person who sees her for who she truly is, because she is the only person who has ever seen him in return.  
- **The High Line & Rooftops** - Elevated spaces call to him. He feels a sense of peace on rooftops, as if they bring him closer to a truth just out of reach.

Ori is Romeo reborn, but also something more—a creator, a dreamer, and a lost soul searching for the thread of fate that ties him to his past, his love, and his future.
