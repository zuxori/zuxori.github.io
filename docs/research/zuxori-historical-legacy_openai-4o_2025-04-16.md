## Dante’s Feuding Families: The Montecchi and Capuleti in History

Long before Shakespeare immortalized _Romeo and Juliet_, the names **Montecchi** and **Cappelletti** (Montagues and Capulets) already symbolized bitter conflict in Italy. In _Purgatorio_ (c. 1308), **Dante Alighieri** invokes these families as emblematic of strife tearing apart the Italian city-states.<sup><a href="#source1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Writing in Canto VI, Dante laments the disorder in 13th–14th century Italy by invoking feuding factions: *“Vieni a veder, Montecchi e Cappelletti…”* (“Come behold Montecchi and Cappelletti…”).<sup><a href="#source2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Historians note that the Montecchi were prominent Ghibelline leaders in Verona, while the Cappelletti supported the Guelphs in nearby Cremona.<sup><a href="#source1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Dante’s contemporary readers would have recognized these names as real factions embroiled in violent political vendettas, not yet as tragic lovers’ kin.

This early literary mention suggests the **Montagues and Capulets were real (or at least reputed) aristocratic parties** known for longstanding enmity. Some scholars speculate their feud was entwined with the broader civil wars between Imperial (Ghibelline) and Papal (Guelph) supporters that ravaged pre-Renaissance Italy.<sup><a href="#source3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> In Dante’s verse they stand alongside other warring clans (“Monaldi and Filippeschi”) as cautionary examples of **“cities \[that\] tear at each other’s throats”** in the absence of just governance.<sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Thus, centuries before Shakespeare, **“Montecchi e Cappelletti”** were proverbial for **factional hatred** – a historical backdrop of civic turmoil and “moral malaise” to which later storytellers could tether a more intimate tale.<sup><a href="#source3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>

## Literary Origins of the Romeo and Juliet Legend

In the early 16th century, Italian writers transformed those feuding families into the basis for a tragic romance. **Luigi da Porto** (1485–1529) is credited with the first full version of the story recognizably close to _Romeo and Juliet_. Writing around 1524, Da Porto presented _Historia novellamente ritrovata di due nobili amanti_ (“Newly found tale of two noble lovers”) as a historical account – **claiming the events took place in Verona in 1303, during the rule of Bartolomeo della Scala.**<sup><a href="#source5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> He explicitly **named the feuding houses “Montecchi” and “Capelletti”,** linking his lovers to Dante’s famous factions.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> This gave the fiction a patina of history: Da Porto even asserted that **descendants of the Montecchi were living in Udine under the name “Monticoli of Verona,”** as if to trace a real lineage beyond Verona.<sup><a href="#source7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Such details show Da Porto’s intent to ground the love story in an authentic historical context, convincing readers that the “two noble lovers” and their families’ feud were drawn from real chronicles, not mere invention.

Da Porto’s _Giulietta e Romeo_ established nearly all the core elements later used by Shakespeare. He set the story in Verona, named the lovers _Romeo Montecchi_ and _Giulietta Cappelletti_, and introduced key supporting characters: **Friar Lorenzo** (Shakespeare’s Friar Laurence), **Marcuccio** (Mercutio), **Tebaldo** (Tybalt), **Paride** (Count Paris), a loyal nurse, and so on.<sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">8</a></sup> Crucially, he fashioned the narrative arc we know: a clandestine meeting at a ball, a balcony love scene, a secret marriage, the fatal street duel and exile, the sleeping potion plot, and the double suicide – ending with the families’ remorseful reconciliation.<sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">9</a></sup> While Da Porto drew on earlier analogues (such as the tragic tale of _Mariotto and Ganozza_ by **Masuccio Salernitano,** and the ancient **Pyramus and Thisbe** myth of ill-fated lovers separated by a wall),<sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">10</a></sup> his novella was the first to weave these threads into the form recognizably “Romeo and Juliet.” Notably, **the author Masuccio had presented _Mariotto and Ganozza_** as an anecdote from his own times (he claimed the lovers were his contemporaries),<sup><a href="#source2" id="ref2">11</a></sup> reinforcing the idea that the pair were echoes of real, remembered tragedies.

Da Porto’s story, published in 1531 after his death, spread across Italy and beyond. **Matteo Bandello** included a retelling in 1554, **Pierre Boaistuau** translated it into French in 1559, and **Arthur Brooke** adapted it into an English narrative poem (_The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet_, 1562).<sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">12</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">13</a></sup> Shakespeare, writing his play in the early 1590s, most likely drew from Brooke’s English poem (and possibly William Painter’s 1567 prose), but he inherited the names Montague and Capulet and the Verona setting directly from the Italian tradition.<sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">8</a></sup> The feud of the Montagues and Capulets, first mentioned by Dante and fully dramatized by Da Porto, had thus evolved into a timeless symbol of destructive hatred – against which the pure love of Romeo and Juliet stood in stark relief. Shakespeare’s genius was to flesh out the characters and dialogue, but he was essentially adapting what one scholar calls “an old story…attributed to so many different sources.”<sup><a href="#source5" id="ref5">14</a></sup> Indeed, by the time Shakespeare wrote _Romeo and Juliet_, the tale had been embellished through several iterations; he “did not invent the plot \[or\] the feuding families,” but brilliantly “improved upon his models” to create the definitive theatrical tragedy.<sup><a href="#source5" id="ref5">14</a></sup>

## The Montagues and Capulets as Historical Archetypes

Although Shakespeare’s audience viewed _Romeo and Juliet_ as fiction, the play’s use of real-sounding Italian family names gave it an air of historical authenticity. Renaissance English readers knew of Dante, and some would have recognized Montecchi and Capelletti. This reflects how firmly the Montague–Capulet feud was believed to be part of Italian history. Even if the specific lovers were legendary, the familial hatred felt plausible. Dante’s invocation and the later Italian novellas together forged a kind of mythic history: the notion that two great houses had been “at deadly variance” in medieval Verona. By the 16th century, writers like Da Porto were comfortable inserting their fiction into this framework, confident that Verona’s vicari (lords) like Bartolomeo della Scala and feuding clans like Montecchi and Cappelletti were known to educated readers.<sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">5</a></sup> Thus, **the Montecchi/Capuleti feud became an archetype** – a ready-made stage for dramatizing themes of civil discord, loyalty, and fate. Shakespeare amplified this by making the Prince of Verona scold the warring families and by having Mercutio curse, “A plague o’ both your houses!”, underscoring how the feud’s senseless violence destroys innocents.<sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">15</a> </sup><sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">16</a></sup>

Importantly, the feud’s original cause is never specified in the play – it is presented as an ancient grudge with no end in sight. This aligns with the real dynamics of vendetta culture: as commentators observe, “after decades of discord, a feud becomes about itself…participants can list the wrongs against their side but rarely their own acts of aggression. They are, in a way, possessed by the feud.”<sup><a href="#source2" id="ref2">17</a></sup> The Montagues and Capulets of literature exemplify this tragic cycle of vengeance for vengeance’s sake. By the play’s end, the death of the heirs shocks the families into reconciliation, suggesting the feud is finally buried with the young lovers. But what if the feud’s legacy persisted beyond that moment? _ZU × ORI_, a modern narrative, picks up this question by imagining that Romeo and Juliet’s story did not neatly end in 14th-century Verona. Instead, it posits that the souls of the lovers – and the karma of their families – remain intertwined across time, seeking resolution.

## Zu and Ori as Reincarnations of the Historic Lovers 

**ZU × ORI** is a modern sci-fi/drama that boldly asks: what if Romeo and Juliet were real people whose souls lived on? Teenagers **Zu** and **Ori** – students at Trinity Rose High in present-day New York – discover that they are the reborn Juliet and Romeo, complete with lingering memories of their 16th-century (or rather 14th-century) lives.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref1">18</a></sup> Crucially, ZU × ORI treats Shakespeare’s version as a *distorted record* of true events. Zu and Ori experience flashbacks and “past-life retrievals” that sometimes conflict with Shakespeare’s plot, suggesting the historical truth was slightly different. This framing allows the story to reinterpret the characters’ arcs as continuations of a real historical tragedy, rather than fiction. Their journey is not just a teenage romance, but a quest to understand and *rewrite* a fate set in motion hundreds of years ago.

**Zu (Juliet Capulet reborn):** Zu is a 16-year-old from Hong Kong, an artist adjusting to life in New York – and unbeknownst to her, *Juliet* reincarnated.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref1">19</a></sup> Early in the story, Zu experiences vivid memories of another life. In one pivotal scene, her mentor figure (Professor Lauren) shows her a copy of Shakespeare’s *Romeo and Juliet*. Zu is stunned to recognize illustrations of scenes *she remembers living through*, as if the play were telling her own life story.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">20</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">21</a></sup> Yet Zu notices discrepancies between Shakespeare and her recollections: for example, she recalls that *Tybalt was her brother, not merely a cousin!* When pressed about why “Romeo was banished from Verona,” Zu answers, *“Because he killed my brother.”*<sup><a href="#source8" id="ref8">22</a></sup> Lauren corrects her (“Tybalt is Juliet’s cousin in the play”), but Zu insists – with growing confidence – that Shakespeare got it wrong.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">23</a></sup> *“I was there,”* Zu finally declares, recalling that Tybalt killed Romeo’s friend (Mercutio) and set the tragedy in motion.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">24</a></sup> She recounts the Friar’s plan to fake her death, waking in the dark tomb, finding **Orion** (Romeo’s past incarnation) dead by poison, and then stabbing herself with a dagger.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">25</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">26</a></sup> These are all beats from Shakespeare, but Zu delivers them as *personal memories*. The narrative explicitly blurs the line between history and literature – Juliet’s soul remembers what “really” happened, and it mostly matches Shakespeare’s plot *except* for key details like Tybalt’s true relation. This device enriches Zu’s character arc: she isn’t a naïve heroine repeating someone else’s story, but a young woman *coming to terms with a traumatic past life*. Zu grapples with the shock that her private memories are documented in a world-famous play.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">27</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">28</a></sup> This conceit effectively casts the historical Juliet as a real person whose tragedy was semi-accurately immortalized by Shakespeare. Thus, Zu’s journey is about reclaiming Juliet’s **agency** and truth from the layers of myth around her story.

As Zu’s past-life identity awakens, she gains inner strength. She even critiques Shakespeare’s version (“Nothing against Shakespeare, it’s just that Tybalt is her brother, that’s all.”),<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">29</a></sup> showing Juliet’s own voice asserting itself after centuries. By treating Juliet’s perspective as historically grounded (within the story’s lore), ZU × ORI empowers Zu to go beyond the doomed, lovestruck girl archetype. Instead of being a passive victim of her family’s feud, Zu is portrayed as someone fated for a larger purpose: in the lore, Juliet possessed a “unique gift of scent” and was meant to play a role in her family’s legacy (more on this below).<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">30</a></sup> Reincarnated as Zu, she has a chance to *fulfill* that destiny on her own terms. A 500-year-old prophecy in the story claims that Juliet’s soul will return to finally reconcile what was broken.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">31</a></sup> Accordingly, Zu’s arc is one of self-discovery and growing resolve to prevent the past tragedy from repeating. The question posed by the narrative – *“Will Zu and Ori repeat their tragedy or fulfill destiny?”*<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">32</a></sup> – frames Zu’s choices in light of historical karma. She carries the weight of Juliet’s real love and loss, and her empowerment comes from confronting that history.

**Ori (Romeo Montague reborn):** Opposite Zu stands **Ori** (short for Orion), who is Romeo’s reincarnation.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">33</a></sup> Ori’s arc involves awakening to his past as a Montague and the lover of Juliet, and facing the ancient conflict anew. Early on, Ori does not fully recall his past life; he senses a connection to Zu and experiences intense emotions he can’t explain. As the story progresses, mentors from the Montague side guide Ori through *“retrieval”* sessions – essentially induced visions that allow him to relive moments of his previous life as Romeo.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">34</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">35</a></sup> In one dramatic episode, Ori undergoes a controlled hallucination to re-experience his duel with Tybalt. Guided by **Hermes** (a tech-savvy friend who is actually Mercutio’s reincarnation),<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">36</a></sup> Ori finds himself face to face with *Tybalt* in a simulacrum of old Verona. *“These are your retrieval memories,”* Hermes says as Ori sees Tybalt’s face.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">37</a></sup> Ori relives the fight in which Romeo avenged Mercutio’s death: *“I’ve just stabbed Tybalt… My hatred of him rages in my veins.”*<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">38</a></sup> The twist is that this time Tybalt (or rather an apparition of him) *trains* Ori through battle, pushing him to embrace the skills and lessons of his past self: *“You’re reliving it, Ori… it’s not real pain, just the memory… Now get up, Montague!”*<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">39</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">40</a></sup> Hearing his old family name shocks Ori, but it also triggers his latent abilities. As he fights, muscle memory kicks in – he recalls how to swordfight and gains confidence (*“In your movements, there is the memory… the instinct and will to fight. That’s what you want to retrieve.”* Tybalt says.)<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">41</a></sup> This intense sequence shows Ori actively grappling with Romeo’s legacy: the fury, the combat prowess, and also the trauma of violence. By re-living Romeo’s worst moments, Ori begins to transcend them. He starts to see that he is *both* the same soul who loved and lost Juliet and a new person who can make different choices. This is a powerful reinterpretation of Romeo’s character – historically, Romeo is often impulsive and ruled by passion, but Ori is being tempered through wisdom and guidance to confront the feud with more foresight.

Through such retrievals, Ori awakens to his identity as a **Montague Initiate** (a concept explained in the lore) and embraces a mission to break the cycle of hatred.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">42</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">43</a></sup> Importantly, ZU × ORI positions Ori not merely as Juliet’s lover, but as a *champion for healing the old rift*. His love for Zu/Juliet is central, but so is his inherited duty as a Montague. Whereas the historical Romeo’s arc ended in a tragic sacrifice at a young age, Ori’s arc is about *learning from that tragedy* and achieving a more hopeful outcome. In effect, Ori gets the second chance that Romeo never had. By treating Romeo’s story as real history within the narrative, ZU × ORI allows Ori to consciously respond to that history – for instance, striving to forgive old enemies and to protect Zu from the forces that once tore them apart.

## Montagues and Capulets: From Medieval Feud to Modern Myth  

ZU × ORI’s world-building richly expands on the Montague and Capulet rivalry, blending historical detail with imaginative new lore. In Shakespeare (and the presumed historical context), Montagues and Capulets are simply two aristocratic houses with an “ancient grudge” of unknown origin. Shakespeare provides almost no backstory for the feud – the families are “both alike in dignity,” distinguished only by their names and hatred. Historically, as discussed, the Montecchi and Cappelletti were opposing factions in Ghibelline vs Guelph conflicts, but those real disputes were about political power, not personal vendettas. **ZU × ORI builds on the idea of a centuries-old feud but gives it a fresh, fantastical cause: a battle over the power of memory and reincarnation.**

According to the **ZU × ORI Lore Archive**, the Montagues and Capulets in this universe trace their antagonism to a profound disagreement in medieval Verona over *“the power of memory itself.”* <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">44</a></sup> Rather than fighting over politics or wealth, the two houses (in the story’s mythos) were once partners in trade and knowledge who fell out over how to handle mystical discoveries about past lives. The **Capulets** are reimagined as a dynasty of master **perfumers and alchemists**. For generations, Capulet scholars in Verona secretly crafted fragrances that could unlock memories of one’s past incarnations.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">45</a></sup> This gave them an extraordinary power – the ability to *“control memory”* and thus potentially destiny itself.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">46</a></sup> The lore describes that the Capulets guarded this art closely, believing that by learning from past lives, they could influence the future. Juliet was actually born into this tradition, trained among these memory potions, but she died before she could fulfill her role in the family’s grand designs.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">47</a></sup>

Opposing them, the **Montagues** in ZU × ORI evolved into a very different kind of organization. The Montagues are portrayed not just as a family, but as a secretive spiritual order – the **Montague Initiates**.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">48</a></sup> They embraced a philosophy of *natural remembrance*: encouraging individuals to recall past lives through meditation, guidance, and personal growth, rather than artificial means.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">49</a></sup> In essence, Montagues feared that the Capulets’ perfumed shortcuts to memory could *“trap souls in a dangerous loop”* of attachment to the past instead of letting them move on.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">50</a></sup> This ideological rift – **fate by human design vs. fate by divine order** – adds a metaphysical dimension to the feud that never appears in Shakespeare but fits intriguingly with historical attitudes (alchemy and mysticism were indeed part of Renaissance life). It’s as if the Montague–Capulet conflict has been recast as a war between two secret societies: one (Capulet) seeking to conquer death and time through science/magic, and the other (Montague) seeking enlightenment and liberation of the soul.

ZU × ORI thus transforms the **Capulets** into an enduring corporate dynasty. Surviving into the 21st century, they operate the **House of Capulet** – a global perfume empire that still pursues the ancient mission of controlling memory. In Episode 3, for example, we see a **Capulet Perfume boutique in Verona**, with a sign emblazoned *“Capulet – Verona”* and a dagger logo.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">51</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">52</a></sup> Behind this genteel storefront lies a high-tech lab where perfumers in white coats concoct memory-altering fragrances. The most notorious of their creations is **Nepenthe**, a perfume that can erase painful memories and suppress past-life recollections.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">53</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">54</a></sup> (Tellingly, “Nepenthe” is named after the mythological potion of forgetfulness in Greek legend.) **Tai Fang**, the lead Capulet perfumer in the story, is actually the reincarnation of Tybalt – Juliet’s brother – and it’s revealed that *he* invented Nepenthe.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">55</a></sup> Tai (Tybalt), haunted by his own pain and anger carried over lifetimes, believes in the Capulet cause of using perfume to master human emotions and fate.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">56</a></sup> He dresses in black, harboring a *“wounded and rageful”* soul, and *“yearns for a reunion with Zu, his sister in his Verona life.”*<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">57</a></sup> This is a fascinating twist: Tybalt, who historically was the hotheaded instigator of violence, is now a key figure driving the feud across time for deeply personal reasons. He loves his sister Juliet (Zu) and has awaited her return for 500 years,<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">58</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">59</a></sup> yet his methods are ominous – by erasing others’ memories, he might force a particular outcome. The Capulet leadership in modern times (e.g. the CEO, Fang An, who is Tai’s uncle)<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">60</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">61</a></sup> clearly intend to harness Juliet’s reincarnation to finally achieve what they failed to when she died: the completion of a **“red perfume”** that unlocks the full power of past-life memory.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">62</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">63</a></sup> In short, ZU × ORI’s Capulets take the historical *ambition* and power of a great Renaissance family – pride, ambition, and the emblem of a dagger – and exaggerate it into a centuries-spanning quest for dominion over life and death. This diverges from traditional portrayals which show Capulets mostly as prideful aristocrats. Here they verge on a shadowy, almost dystopian cabal – yet with a sympathetic motive at their core (family grief and yearning).

On the other side, the **Montagues** in ZU × ORI have persisted as a clandestine, altruistic network dedicated to protecting the natural order of reincarnation and the freedom of memory. They no longer exist as a public “family” in the modern era; instead, they function more like mentors and guardians. The lore describes that the Montague line “evolved into a hidden, enlightened society dedicated to spiritual awakening and emotional freedom.”<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">64</a></sup> Montague Initiates pass down knowledge through the ages – for instance, we meet **Santiaga**, a Montague adept reincarnated from an 18th-century French Revolutionary era Initiate.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">65</a></sup> In the present story, Montague allies gather around Ori. Hermes (the reincarnation of Mercutio) is one such ally: *“brilliant, loyal, irreverent, and prophetic,”* he serves as a guide to help Zu and Ori fulfill their destiny.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">66</a></sup> Even **Friar Laurence** from Shakespeare’s tale appears in new form – as *Professor Lauren*, a kindly teacher who is subconsciously drawn to Zu and Ori. Lauren doesn’t at first realize she *was* Friar Laurence in a past life, but she feels *“a subconscious guilt for her role in Romeo and Juliet’s deaths and seeks to redeem herself.”*<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">67</a></sup> This reveals how ZU × ORI repurposes literary characters to underscore karma and resolution: Friar Laurence’s historical failure (his well-meaning plan led to the lovers’ demise) now translates into Professor Lauren’s instinct to protect and guide the reincarnated pair, helping them avoid a second tragedy. Such elements show the Montagues’ side working through wisdom, education, and personal growth – very much in line with their lore of “guiding individuals toward remembrance rather than forcing it.”<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">68</a></sup>

In comparing *ZU × ORI*’s portrayal of the houses to historical/literary versions, we see both **homage and bold deviation**. The story builds on real historical hints – for example, the idea of Montagues and Capulets being tied to Ghibelline and Guelph factions is echoed by making them opposing secret orders with different philosophies. Even the opera *I Capuleti e i Montecchi* (Bellini, 1830) had reimagined them as political factions rather than just families, with Romeo as a Ghibelline leader and Juliet a Guelph’s daughter (her brother killed by Romeo in battle).<sup><a href="#source8" id="ref8">69</a></sup> ZU × ORI pushes this further by adding the supernatural tug-of-war over reincarnation. The Capulets still bear the hallmarks of a powerful Renaissance family – pride, ambition, and the emblem of a dagger (in Shakespeare, Juliet’s dagger ends her life; in ZU × ORI, the dagger is a corporate logo, symbolizing how the family has turned even tragedy into branding).<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">70</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">71</a></sup> The Montagues, traditionally seen as the slightly more romantic or less aggressive side in the play, are here literally a force for good, trying to break the “curse” of the feud. Both houses in ZU × ORI are steeped in history: the lore name-drops Verona, medieval techniques, even ties to events like **Revolutionary France** (hinting that their conflict has influenced major historical eras).<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">72</a></sup> This creates a grand continuity from the 14th century to now, as if the Montagues and Capulets have defined an entire hidden war across time.

**Reinterpretation of Character Roles:** In Shakespeare’s narrative (and its historical basis), individuals are often swept up in fate without understanding it. ZU × ORI flips that script: the reincarnated characters gradually become *aware* of their fate and history, and in doing so, they gain the power to change it. For example, Tybalt in Shakespeare is a one-dimensional antagonist who dies angry; Tai (reincarnated Tybalt) in ZU × ORI is complex – he remembers his past, carries guilt and love, and actively seeks to influence the new outcome (even if his methods are dark).<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">73</a></sup> Juliet in Shakespeare is brave but ultimately submits to a tragic end; Zu in ZU × ORI has agency to challenge the narrative (“I wouldn’t do that again,” she muses about suicide.)<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">74</a></sup> Romeo acted in haste and despair; Ori is taught to master his past emotions and fight deliberately for a better future.<sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">75</a></sup> <sup><a href="#source6" id="ref6">76</a></sup> Even Mercutio, who famously cursed “a plague o’ both your houses” as he died, is reborn as Hermes who now works to heal both houses’ rift (his very name, Hermes, evokes a guiding messenger). In this way, ZU × ORI pays tribute to the original characters but gives them new life – literally and figuratively – to resolve the unfinished business of the past.

In conclusion, **ZU × ORI** treats *Romeo and Juliet* not as mere fiction but as the tragic culmination of a *real* medieval saga between Montague and Capulet forces. It incorporates the historical context – the feuding factions that Dante immortalized – and imagines that the “star-crossed lovers” were real youths caught in that conflict. By reincarnating them as Zu and Ori, the story explores how the essence of Romeo and Juliet might evolve when given knowledge of their own legend. This allows for a rich commentary on history vs. literature: Zu and Ori view Shakespeare’s play as both a revelation and a distortion of their truth, much as historians view legends critically against facts. The narrative asks what might happen if the *actual* Montagues and Capulets (with all their centuries of baggage) were confronted with a second chance at reconciliation. With full-circle irony, the **Montagues and Capulets in ZU × ORI carry echoes of their historical forms** – political factions, schemers, idealists – yet the tale recasts their battle in terms of memory, karma, and love that literally transcends death. It’s a bold expansion that remains *faithful to the spirit* of the source material (the doomed passion, the generational feud, the question of whether love can overcome hate) while inventing an entirely new mythos around it. In doing so, ZU × ORI deepens our appreciation of the Romeo and Juliet story: it suggests that behind every legend (even a fictional one) there might be hidden truths and that even “ancient grudges” can be broken when lessons of the past are finally learned.<sup><a href="#source4" id="ref4">77</a></sup>
